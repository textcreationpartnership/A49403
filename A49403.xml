            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>BY what Steps I am advanc'd thus far <hi>in my Enquiry after Happineſs,</hi> and what Connexion or Coherence there is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>This</hi> and two <hi>other</hi> Diſcourſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Publiſh'd on That Subject, is very obvious. In the <hi>Firſt,</hi> I endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thoſe Objections which repreſent all Enquiries and Attempts after true Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in this Life, either as fantaſtick or unneceſſary, or which is as bad, vain and to no purpoſe: And after I have aſſerted the <hi>Value</hi> and <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of Happineſs, I do in general point out the true Reaſons of our ill Succeſs and Diſappointment in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of it. In the <hi>Second,</hi> I ſtate the true Notion of <hi>Human Life,</hi> inſiſt upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds of it, and ſhew what Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Virtues the <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative</hi> Life demand; and then conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how Life may be prolonged and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. In This <hi>Third,</hi> I proſecute the ſame Deſign, which I had in the two For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; the promoting Human Happineſs. For <hi>Life, Perfection</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29455:7"/>
a cloſe and inſeparable Dependance on one another. For as <hi>Life</hi> which is the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Exerciſe and Employment of our Powers and Faculties, does naturally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance on, and terminate in <hi>Perfection,</hi> ſo <hi>Perfection,</hi> which is nothing elſe, but the Maturity of Human Virtue, does na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally end in that Reſt and Peace, that Tranquility, Serenity and Joy of Mind, which we call <hi>Happineſs.</hi> Now <hi>Perfection</hi> in an Abſtracted and Metaphiſical Notion of it, is a State that admits neither of Acceſſion nor Dimunition. But talking of it Practically, and in a manner accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the Nature of things, the <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of Man conſiſts in ſuch Endowments and Attainments as Man is generally capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of in this Life. And becauſe Man may be conſidered either in Relation to <hi>This,</hi> or to <hi>another</hi> World, therefore <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Perfection</hi> may I think, naturally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be divided into <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi> By <hi>Secular,</hi> I mean that which regards our Intereſt in this Life; By <hi>Religious,</hi> That which ſecures it in Eternity, the one more directly and immediately aims at the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Man; the other at the Favour of God; the one purſues that Happineſs, what ever it be, that is to be found in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29455:7"/>
and worldly Advantages; the other, That which flows from Virtue and a good Conſcience. 'Tis eaſie now to diſcern, which of Theſe two kinds of <hi>Perfection,</hi> is the more deſireable; the one purifies and exalts our Nature, the other poliſhes and varniſhes it; the one makes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Gentleman, the other a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; the Succeſs of the one is precarious, that of the other certain; having no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on Time or Chance, the Humour or Fancy of Man, the Pleaſure of the one is ſhort and Superficial; That of the other Great and Laſting: The <hi>World</hi> admires the one, and <hi>God</hi> approves the other. To be throughly perſwaded of <hi>This,</hi> is a good ſtep towards true Wiſdom, as being that, which will enable Man to ſteer the whole Courſe of Life aright. But while I prefer the one, I do not preſcribe the Neglect or Contempt of the other, ſo far am I from it; that I am of Opinion, That Secular <hi>Perfection</hi> has very often ſome Influence upon our Spiritual State, as well as its uſe and Advantage in Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to our Temporal one: That the moſt admir'd Accompliſhments of a Secular Life, are ſo far from being inconſiſtent with Religion, that they naturally ſpring
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29455:8"/>
from it, and thrive and flouriſh moſt when they are influenc'd and cultivated by it; and judging that it might be of ſome ſervice to the World, to inform and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of <hi>This,</hi> I had it ſometimes in my Thoughts, to have Treated here as well of Secular as Religious Perfection: But doubting how well this might ſuit with my Function, and how far the beſt Obſervations I cou'd make on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, might fall ſhort of anſwering the Expectation of Men of worldly Parts and Experience, I laid aſide the Deſign. Here then, I confine my Meditations wholly to <hi>Religious Perfection;</hi> I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Nature of it, both in General, and in Particular; not only stating the true Notion of it, but alſo deſcending to the ſeveral Branches and Parts of it; I free it from thoſe Miſtakes and Diſputes that perplex and encumber it, I lay down the Motives to it, and preſcribe the Ways of obtaining it.</p>
            <p>After this ſhort Account of my Deſign, the next thing I am to do is, to prevent if I can, thoſe Prejudices, which may either wholly fruſtrate, or at leaſt very much hinder and diminiſh the ſucceſs and Influence of it. Some are apt to ſtartle
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29455:8"/>
at the very mention of <hi>Perfection,</hi> they have entertain'd ſuch humble Thoughts, not only of Human Nature, but as it ſeems, of Divine Grace too, and Evangelical Righteouſneſs, that all talk of Perfection ſeems to them like the Preaching a New Goſpel, and an obtruding upon the World a Fantastick Scheme of proud and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Morality. But this Fear will ſoon vaniſh, when I tell ſuch, that I diſcourſe of the <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> not <hi>Angels:</hi> And, that I treat <hi>This,</hi> not like a Monk or a Sublime and ſubtle Schoolman, but like one, who have been daily converſant with the Doubts and Scruples, with the Fears and Frailties of Human Nature, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting Souls. I do not pretend to bleſs the World with the Diſcovery of <hi>New</hi> Truths. If at any time I place <hi>Old</hi> ones in a better Light, if I wipe off the Duſt which Diſpute and Time, and the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Manners has here and there ſcattered upon them, 'tis the utmost I aim at.</p>
            <p>But how Numerous will ſome ſay, are the Controverſies that have in every Age perplex'd this Subject? <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Perfection</hi> and <hi>Sin, Merit, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerogation,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:29455:9"/>
&amp;c. Theſe are Themes that have exerciſed, and embroiled the Church of Christ, almoſt through all the ſeveral Ages of it down to this Day: And with how little Advantage to the Honour of Chriſtianity, or the Intereſt of Virtue have the brighteſt Parts and the deepest Learning been here employ'd? To <hi>This,</hi> all I have to ſay is, I write Practically, and conſult the Intereſt of Souls, not <hi>Parties.</hi> I cannot but ſee, and that with Trouble and Regret, how much Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity has in almoſt all times ſuffered, by thoſe Nice and Subtle, by thoſe Obſtinate and paſſionate Diſputes, with which Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have even oppreſſed and ſtifled the moſt <hi>Practical</hi> Subjects; and do moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire to ſee the Spirit of <hi>Polemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Divinity caſt out of the Church of Chriſt, and <hi>That</hi> of a <hi>Practical</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental one</hi> eſtabliſh'd in the Room of it. Though therefore, I have conſider'd thoſe Controverſies which concern my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it was with no other Deſign, then to guard and fortifie my Reader, againſt the ill Influence of ſeveral Errors with which they abound. I decline all uſeleſs Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, and labour wholly to reſtore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29455:9"/>
to its Native Strength and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo that I think this Objection will not touch me, who do not propoſe to write a <hi>Learned,</hi> but an <hi>Uſeful</hi> Book.</p>
            <p>If any Man be apprehenſive, that 'tis impoſſible to aſſert the Doctrine of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> without looking a little too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably towards <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> or <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm,</hi> or ſomething of this kind, I do here aſſure ſuch a one, that I advance no <hi>Perfection</hi> that raiſes Men above the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe or Need of <hi>Means,</hi> or invites them to neglect the <hi>Word, Prayer,</hi> or <hi>Sacraments,</hi> or is rais'd on any other Foundation then the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I revive not <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> nor claſh with St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> I need not thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions which he makes <hi>Coeleſtius</hi> in the Cloſe of his Book <hi>de Perfectione Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae.</hi> I am perſwaded that the ſtrength of <hi>Nature</hi> is too ſlight a Foundation to build <hi>Perfection</hi> on: I contend for <hi>Freedom</hi> from no other Sin then <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Voluntary,</hi> and <hi>Deliberate;</hi> And let Concupiſcence, or any unavoidable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper or Diſorder of our Nature be what it will, all that I aim at here is, the <hi>Reducing,</hi> not <hi>Extirpating</hi> it. And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29455:10"/>
finally, how earneſtly ſoever I exhort to <hi>Perfection,</hi> I can very well content my ſelf with St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s <hi>Notion</hi> of it, namely, that it is nothing elſe, but <hi>a daily Progreſs towards That pure and unſpotted Holineſs, which we ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to in another Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I think I have ſufficiently guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this following Diſcourſe againſt the Miſapprehenſions and Jealouſies of all, who have any ſerious Concern for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, how much ſoever they may be ſwayed by ſome particular Opinions. But after all, I do not expect that it ſhould meet with a very obliging Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from a great Part of the World. Many there are, who will ever openly rally and ridicule all Attempts of this kind: And there are Others, who will ſecretly ſlight, and inwardly deſpiſe them as the vain and fond Projects of well meaning indeed, but very weak, and unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd Mortals. But this moves me lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; theſe Men are generally too much ſtrangers to <hi>Sincerity,</hi> to be competent Judges of <hi>Perfection:</hi> Nor do I wonder, if the Corrupt and Vitious part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, be infected with as much Malice
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29455:10"/>
and Envy againſt extraordinary Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as ſome are againſt Power and Greatneſs. The Conſciouſneſs of much Baſeneſs and Corruption in ones ſelf, is apt to make one ſtrive to bring down all Men to the ſame Level, and to believe that there is nothing of <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the World, but only a Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or Hipocritical Pretention to it. This is an Opinion, that ill Men gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily embrace, becauſe it gives them ſome kind of Peace, Security, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; whereas the contrary Opinion, as it wou'd be apt to make them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of their <hi>Preſent</hi> State, ſo wou'd it make them fearful and apprehenſive of their <hi>Future</hi> One. I write not therefore to ſuch as theſe, nor can be much concerned what Cenſure they paſs on a Deſign, against which, they have an Inveterate and Obstinate Averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The Method I obſerve in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe is. In the <hi>Firſt Section,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>Perfection</hi> more generally: In the <hi>Second,</hi> the ſeveral parts of it; And in the <hi>Laſt</hi> the <hi>Obſtacles</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments</hi> of our attaining it. In the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29455:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
two firſt Sections, I always firſt fix and explain the <hi>Notion</hi> of that State of Virtue which I Diſcourſe of. Next I proceed to the <hi>Fruits</hi> or <hi>Advantages</hi> of it; and in the laſt place preſcribe the <hi>Method,</hi> by which it may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>

               <p>MOſt Diſputes and Controverſies ariſe from falſe and Miſtaken Notions of the Matter under Debate: And <hi>ſo</hi> I could ſhew it has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened here.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Religion</hi> is nothing elſe but the purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and refining Nature by Grace, the raiſing and exalting our Faculties and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities by Wiſdom and Virtue. <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Perfection</hi> therefore, is nothing elſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29455:12"/>
but the Moral Accompliſhment of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature; ſuch a Maturity of Virtue as Man in this Life is capable of, <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> begins, <hi>Perfection</hi> conſumates the Habit of Righteouſneſs: In the one, Religion is as it were in its Infancy, in the other, in its Strength and Manhood; ſo that <hi>Perfection</hi> in ſhort is nothing elſe, but a ripe and ſetled <hi>Habit</hi> of true <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> According to this Notion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <hi>Perfection,</hi> He is a <hi>Perfect</hi> Man whoſe <hi>Mind</hi> is pure and Vigorous, and his <hi>Body</hi> tame and obſequious, whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> is firm and ſteady, his <hi>Love</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and exalted, and his <hi>Hope</hi> full of Aſſurance, whoſe <hi>Religion</hi> has in it, That Ardour and Conſtancy, and his <hi>Soul</hi> That Tranquility and Pleaſure, which beſpeaks Him a Child of the <hi>Light,</hi> and of the <hi>Day, a Partaker of the Divine Nature, and raiſed above the Corruption which is in the World through Luſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This account of Religious <hi>Perfection,</hi> is ſo natural and eaſie, that I fancy no Man will demand a <hi>Proof</hi> of it; nor ſhould I go about one, were it not to ſerve ſome <hi>further</hi> Ends then the meer Confirmation of it. It has manifeſtly the Countenance both of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29455:12"/>
                  <hi>Scripture;</hi> And how Contradictory ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome Antient and Latter Schemes of <hi>Perfection</hi> ſeem to be, or really are, to one another; yet do they all agree in effect in what I have laid down. If we appeal to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> no Man can doubt, but that an <hi>Habit</hi> of Virtue has much more of Excellence and Merit in it, then ſingle accidental <hi>Acts,</hi> or uncertain Fits and Paſſions; ſince an <hi>Habit</hi> is not only the ſource and ſpring of the nobleſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the moſt elevated Paſſions, but it renders us more regular and ſteady, more uniform and conſtant in every thing that is good. As to good natural <hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> they have little of Strength, little of Perfection in them, till they be raiſed and improved into <hi>Habits.</hi> And for our <hi>Natural Faculties,</hi> they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the <hi>Capacities</hi> of Good or Evil; they are undetermined to the one or other, till they are fix'd and influenced by <hi>Moral</hi> Principles. It remains then, that Religious <hi>Perfection</hi> muſt conſiſt in an <hi>Habit</hi> of Righteouſneſs. And to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all impertinent Scruples and Cavils, I add a <hi>Confirmed</hi> and well eſtabliſhed One.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:29455:13"/>That this is the <hi>Scripture</hi> Notion of <hi>Perfection</hi> is manifeſt. <hi>Firſt,</hi> from the uſe of this Word in Scripture. <hi>Secondly,</hi> from the Characters and Deſcriptions of the beſt and higheſt State which any ever actually attained, or to which we are invited and exhorted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the uſe of the Word: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we find any Mention of <hi>Perfection</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> if we examine the Place well, we ſhall find nothing more intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> an unblameable and unreproveable Life, a State well <hi>advanced</hi> in Knowledge and Virtue. Thus <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright</hi> and <hi>Perfect</hi> are uſed as terms equivalent, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. <hi>and that Man was Perfect and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright, fearing God and eſchewing Evil;</hi> and Pſalm. 37.37. <hi>Mark the perfect Man, and behold the upright Man, for the end of that Man is Peace.</hi> Thus again, when God exhorts <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Perfection,</hi> Gen. 17.1. <hi>I am the Almighty God; walk before me and be thou perfect,</hi> all that He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts him to, is a ſteady <hi>Obedience</hi> to all his Commandments, proceeding from a lively Fear of, and Faith in Him; and this is the general uſe of this word, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> throughout the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29455:13"/>
to ſignifie a ſincere and juſt Man, that feareth God, and eſcheweth Evil, and is well fix'd and eſtabliſhed in his Duty. In the <hi>New Teſtament; Perfection</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the ſame thing which it does in the <hi>Old;</hi> that is, Univerſal Righteouſneſs, and Strength, and Growth in it. Thus the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17. is one, who is <hi>throughly furniſhed to every good work.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Coll.</hi> 4.12. that <hi>Epaphras laboured fervently in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the Colloſſians, that they might ſtand perfect and compleat in all the will of God.</hi> In <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.4. the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man is one, <hi>Who is entire lacking nothing,</hi> i. e. one who has advanced to a <hi>Maturity</hi> of Virtue through Patience and Experience, and is fortified and eſtabliſhed in Faith, Love and Hope. In <hi>this</hi> Senſe of the word <hi>Perfect,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> prays for thoſe to whom he writes his Epiſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. <hi>but the God of all Grace who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us into his Eternal Glory by Chriſt Jeſus, after that ye have ſuffered awhile, make you Perfect, Stabliſh, Strengthen, Settle you.</hi> When St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to go on to <hi>Perfection, Heb.</hi> 6. he means nothing by it, but that ſtate of Manhood which conſiſt in a well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29455:14"/>
                  <hi>Habit</hi> of Wiſdom and Goodneſs. This is plain <hi>firſt</hi> from <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> where he himſelf more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explains his own meaning; <hi>and we deſire that every one of you do ſhew the ſame Diligence, to the full Aſſurance of hope</hi> unto the <hi>End; that ye be not ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but followers of them who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promiſe. Next</hi> from the latter end of the 5 <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> where we diſcern <hi>what</hi> gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his Exhortation; <hi>there</hi> diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing <hi>Chriſtians</hi> into two Claſſes, <hi>Babes</hi> and <hi>Strong Men,</hi> i. e. <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> he deſcribes <hi>Both</hi> at large thus: <hi>For when, for the time ye ought to be Teachers, ye have need that one Teach you again, which be the firſt Principles of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God; and are become ſuch as have need of Milk, and not of strong Meat; For every one that uſeth Milk is unskilful in the word of Righteouſneſs; for he is a Babe; but ſtrong Meat belongeth to them that are of full Age, even thoſe, who by reaſon of uſe have their Senſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil.</hi> And though here the Apoſtle ſeems more immediately to regard the <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> yet the <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:29455:14"/>
muſt never in the Language of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> be ſeparated from it. Much the ſame Remark muſt I add concerning the <hi>Integrity</hi> of Righteouſneſs and the Chriſtian's Progreſs or Advance in it. <hi>Though</hi> the <hi>Scripture,</hi> when it ſpeaks of <hi>Perfection,</hi> do ſometimes more directly referr to the one, and ſometimes to the other; <hi>yet</hi> we muſt ever ſuppoſe that they do mutually imply and include <hi>one another;</hi> ſince otherwiſe the Notion of <hi>Perfection</hi> would be extreamly maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and incompleat. I'll inſiſt therefore no longer on the uſe of the Words <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> in <hi>Scripture:</hi> But as a further Proof that my Notion of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> is truly <hi>Scriptural,</hi> I will ſhew.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the utmoſt <hi>Height,</hi> to which the <hi>Scripture</hi> exhorts us, is nothing more then a Steady <hi>Habit</hi> of Holineſs; that the brighteſt <hi>Characters</hi> it gives of the <hi>Perfect Man,</hi> the lovelieſt <hi>Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> it makes us of the <hi>Perfectest State,</hi> are all made up of the <hi>Natural</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed <hi>Properties</hi> of a Ripe <hi>Habit.</hi> There is no Controverſie that I know of, about the <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Habit,</hi> every Man's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience inſtructs him in the whole Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy of it; We are all agreed, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29455:15"/>
it is a kind of <hi>Second Nature,</hi> that it makes us exert our ſelves with Deſire and Earneſtneſs, with Satisfaction and Pleaſure; that it renders us fix'd in our Choice, and conſtant in our Actions, and almoſt as averſe to thoſe things which are repugnant to it, as we are to thoſe which are diſtaſteful and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our Nature. And that in a word, it ſo entirely, and abſolutely, poſſeſſes the Man, that the Power of it is not to be reſiſted, nor the Empire of it to be ſhaken off; nor can it be removed and extirpated without the greateſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Difficulty imaginable. All this is a confeſs'd and almoſt palpable Truth in <hi>Habits of Sin:</hi> And there is no Reaſon why we ſhould not aſcribe the ſame Force and Efficacy to <hi>Habits of Virtue;</hi> Eſpecially, if we conſider that the Strength, Eaſineſs, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which belong <hi>naturally</hi> to <hi>theſe Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,</hi> receive no ſmall <hi>Acceſſion</hi> from the <hi>Supernatural</hi> Energy and Vigour of the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> I will therefore in few words ſhew how that <hi>State of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> which the <hi>Scripture</hi> invites us to, as our <hi>Perfection,</hi> directly anſwers this account I have given of an <hi>Habit.</hi>

The <hi>first</hi> is, a great <hi>Averſion</hi> for thoſe things which are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to it, or obſtruct us in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it. And this is directly the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man towards
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29455:16"/>
                  <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>Sins;</hi> he is now aſhamed of thoſe things which before he gloried in; he is filled with an Holy Indignation againſt thoſe things which before he took Pleaſure in; and what before he courted with Fondneſs and Paſſion, he now ſhuns with Fear and Vigilance. In brief, the <hi>Scripture</hi> deſcribes ſuch an one as poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with an utter Hatred and Abhorrence of every Evil way, and as an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable Enemy to every thing, that is, an Enemy to his Virtue and his God. Thus <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.163. <hi>I hate and abhor lying, but thy law do I love,</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 128. <hi>Therefore I eſteem all thy Precepts concerning all things to be right, and I hate every falſe way.</hi> And this is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and Natural Effect of Integrity or uprightneſs of Heart; whence 'tis the Obſervation of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Math. 6.24. <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or elſe he will hold to the one and deſpiſe the other.</hi> And indeed every where a Hatred, a Perfect Hatred of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is accounted as a neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Love of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.10. <hi>ye that love the Lord hate Evil;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> reſolves to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29455:16"/>
Practiſe himſelf what he preſcribes to others, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.2.3. <hi>I will behave my ſelf wiſely in a perfect way: O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my Houſe with a perfect Heart: I will ſet no wicked thing before mine Eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aſide, it ſhall not cleave to me.</hi> And how can this be otherwiſe? The Love of God muſt neceſſarily imply an Abhorrence of Evil, and that <hi>Habit</hi> which confirms and increaſes the one, muſt confirm and increaſe the other too.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Next</hi> Property of an <hi>Habit</hi> is, that the <hi>Actions,</hi> which flow from it, are (if we meet not with violent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) performed with <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi> what is <hi>Natural,</hi> is pleaſant and eaſie, and <hi>Habit</hi> is a <hi>Second Nature.</hi> When the love of Virtue, and the hatred of Vice have once rooted themſelves in the Soul; what can be more natural then to follow after the one, and ſhun the other? Since this is no more then embracing and enjoying what we love, and turning our backs on what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. This therefore is one conſtant Character of <hi>Perfection</hi> in <hi>Scripture;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29455:17"/>
Delight,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> are every where ſaid to accompany the Practice of Virtue, when it is once grown up to Strength and Maturity: <hi>The ways of Wiſdom are ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all her Paths are Peace,</hi> Prov. 3.17. <hi>Perfect Love caſteth out Fear,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.18. <hi>and to him that Loves, the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are not grievous,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.3. Hence it is, that <hi>the good Man's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is in the Law of the Lord,</hi> and that <hi>he meditates therein day and night,</hi> Pſal. 1.2. Nor does he delight leſs in <hi>Action</hi> then <hi>Meditation,</hi> but grows in <hi>Grace</hi> as much as <hi>Knowledge;</hi> and abounds daily more and more in <hi>good works,</hi> as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes in the <hi>Comfort</hi> of <hi>the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Conſonant to <hi>this</hi> Property of <hi>Perfection</hi> it is, that in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 19, and 119. and elſewhere frequently, we hear the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi> expreſſing a kind of inconceiveable Joy and Tranſport in the Meditation and Practiſe of the Commands of God. So the firſt Chriſtians who ſpent their Lives in Devotion, Faith, and Charity are ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.46. <hi>to have eaten their Meat with Gladneſs and Singleneſs of Heart.</hi> And 'tis a delightful Deſcription we have of the Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10 <hi>as ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29455:17"/>
yet alway rejoycing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet poſſeſſing all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Vigour</hi> and <hi>Activity,</hi> or much <hi>Earnestneſs</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of Mind, is a <hi>third</hi> Property of an <hi>Habit.</hi> 'Tis impoſſible not to be intent upon thoſe things for which, we have even an <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual</hi> Paſſion, if this <hi>Expreſſion</hi> may be allowed me; an inclination, which has gathered Strength and Authority from Cuſtom, will exert it ſelf with ſome warmth and briskneſs. Now certainly, there is nothing more frequently requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, or attributed to the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man in <hi>Scripture,</hi> then <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Fervency</hi> of Spirit in the ways of God; and no wonder: For when Actions flow at once from Principles and Cuſtom, when they ſpring from Love, and are attended by Pleaſure, and are incited and quicken'd by Faith, and Hope too: How can it be, but that we ſhould repeat 'em with ſome Eagerneſs, and feel an Holy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience as often as we are hindered or diſappointed? And as the Nature of the Thing ſhews, that thus it <hi>ought</hi> to be, ſo are there innumerable Inſtances in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and the <hi>New,</hi> which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29455:18"/>
make it evident, that thus it <hi>was.</hi> Shall I mention the example of our <hi>Lord, who went about doing good,</hi> Act. 10.38. Shall I propoſe the Labours and Travils of St. <hi>Paul?</hi> Theſe Patterns it may be, will be judged by ſome too bright and dazling a Light for us to look on, or at leaſt too Perfect for us to copy after; and yet St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that <hi>he, who ſays he abides in Him, ought himſelf alſo ſo to walk, even as he walked,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.6. and we are exhorted <hi>to be followers of the Apostles, as they were of Chriſt.</hi> But if the Fervency of <hi>Christ,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſeemed to have ſoar'd out of the reach of our imitation, we have <hi>Inferiour</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances enough to prove the Zeal and Fruitfulneſs of <hi>Habitual</hi> Goodneſs. Thus <hi>David</hi> ſays of himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.10. <hi>with my whole Heart have I ſought thee:</hi> and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.25. is ſaid to have <hi>turned to the Lord with all his Soul, and with all his Might.</hi> How fervent was <hi>Anna,</hi> wo <hi>departed not from the Temple, but ſerved God with Faſtings and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, night and day?</hi> Luk. 2.37. how Charitable <hi>Tabitha who was full of good Works and Almſ-deeds which ſhe did?</hi> Act. 9.36. Where ſhall I place <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us?</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:29455:18"/>
With what words ſhall I ſet out his Virtues? with <hi>what</hi> but thoſe of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Act. 10.2. <hi>He was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Man, and one that feared God with all his Houſe, which gave much Alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.</hi> But peradventure ſome may imagine, that there is ſomething ſingular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in theſe Eminent Perſons, which we muſt never hope to equal; but muſt be content to follow them at a vaſt Diſtance. Well, let this be ſo; What have we to ſay to whole <hi>Churches</hi> animated by the ſame Spirit of Zeal? What are we to think of the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> whoſe <hi>Charity,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> thus magnifies, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2, 3. <hi>in a great trial of Affliction, the abundance of their Joy, and their deep Poverty, abounded to the Riches of their Liberality. For to their power I bear record, yea, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their power, they were willing of themſelves.</hi> And, St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>perſwaded</hi> of the <hi>Romans, that they were full of goodneſs filled with all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> Rom. 15.14. And of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> he teſtifies, <hi>that they were enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every thing, and came behind in no gift;</hi> 1 Cor. 1.5, 6. <hi>that they did abound
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29455:19"/>
in all things, in Faith, in diligence,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 8.7. I will ſtop here; 'tis in vain to heap up more Inſtances: I have ſaid enough to ſhew that <hi>Vigour</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency</hi> in the Service of God, is no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Gift, no extraordinary Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of ſome peculiar Favorite of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but the natural and inſeparable <hi>Property</hi> of a well confirmed <hi>Habit</hi> of Holineſs.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, is <hi>Conſtancy</hi> and <hi>Steadineſs</hi> the Property of an <hi>Habit?</hi> It is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Property of <hi>Perfection</hi> too. In <hi>Scripture,</hi> Good Men are every where repreſented <hi>as ſtanding faſt in the Faith, steadfaſt and unmovable in the works of God, holding faſt their Integrity:</hi> In one word, as conſtantly following after Righteouſneſs, and maintaining a good Conſcience towards God and Man. And ſo Natural is This to one <hi>Habitually</hi> good, that St. <hi>John</hi> affirms of ſuch a one <hi>that he cannot ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is born of God doth not commit ſin, for his Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin becauſe he is born of God.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, <hi>Job</hi> is ſaid, <hi>to have feared God and eſchewed Evil,</hi> which muſt be underſtood of the conſtant courſe of his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29455:19"/>
Life. <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>Righteous, walking in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God blameleſs,</hi> Luk. 1.6. <hi>Enoch, Noah, David,</hi> and other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Perſons, who are pronounc'd by God, <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Perfect,</hi> are ſaid in <hi>Scripture, to walk with God, to ſerve Him with a Perfect Heart, with a full purpoſe of Heart to cleave to him,</hi> and the like. And this is that <hi>Conſtancy</hi> which <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are often exhorted to; <hi>watch ye, ſtand faſt in the Faith, quit ye like Men, be ſtrong,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.13. And of which, the firſt followers of our <hi>Lord</hi> left us ſuch remarkable <hi>Examples.</hi> The <hi>Diſciples</hi> are ſaid to have been continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Temple, <hi>bleſſing and praiſing God,</hi> Luk. 24. And the <hi>firſt Chriſtians</hi> are ſaid to <hi>have continued ſtedfastly in the Apoſtles Doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers,</hi> Acts 2.42.</p>
               <p>Thus I think I have ſufficiently clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Notion of <hi>Perfection</hi> from <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> Nor need I multiply more Texts to prove, what I think, no Man can doubt of, unleſs he miſtake the main Deſign and End of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> which is to raiſe and exalt us to a ſteady <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:29455:20"/>
of Holineſs: <hi>The end of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.5. <hi>is Charity out of a pure heart, and of a good Conſcience, and of Faith unfeigned.</hi> This is the utmoſt <hi>Perfection</hi> Man is capable of, to have his Mind enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and his Heart purified; and to be inform'd, acted and influenc'd by Faith and Love, as by a vital principle: And all this is Eſſential to <hi>Habitual</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>If any one deſire <hi>further</hi> Light or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in this Matter, let him read the eighth <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and he will ſoon acknowledge, that he there finds the ſubſtance of what I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terto advanced. <hi>There,</hi> though the <hi>Word</hi> it ſelf be not found, the <hi>thing</hi> called <hi>Perfection,</hi> is deſcribed in all the Strength and Beauty, in all the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Advantages of it: There the Diſciple of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is repreſented as one, <hi>who walks not after the Fleſh but after the Spirit,</hi> as one, <hi>whom the Law of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus has ſet free from the Law of Sin and Death,</hi> one who <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>does not mind or reliſh the things of the Fleſh, but the things of the Spirit,</hi> one <hi>in whom the Spirit of Chriſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29455:20"/>
dwells:</hi> He does not ſtand at the Door and knock, he does not make a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent viſit; but here he reigns, and rules, and inhabits: One finally in whom <hi>the Body is dead becauſe of Sin, but the Spirit is life becauſe of Righteouſneſs.</hi> And the Reſult of all this is the Joy and Confidence, the Security and Tranſport that becomes the Child of God. <hi>Ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage again to Fear, but ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father. The Spirit it ſelf bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth witneſs with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God; and if Children, then Heirs, heirs of God, and joynt-heirs with Chriſt.</hi> And now 'tis no wonder, if the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man <hi>long for the Revelation of the Glory of the Sons of God;</hi> if he cry out in Rapture, <hi>if God be for me who can be againſt me? who ſhall lay any thing to the Charge of God's Elect? who ſhall ſeperate me from the Love of Chriſt?</hi> and ſo on. If any one would ſee the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in <hi>Fewer</hi> words, he needs but caſt his Eye on <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. <hi>But now being made free from Sin, and become Servants to God, ye have your Fruit

               <p>AFter I have ſhewed that this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Perfection</hi> is warranted by <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> I ſee not why I ſhould be very Solicitous, whether it do, or do not claſh with the <hi>Opinions</hi> of Men. But the Truth is, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine not ſo much the <hi>Expreſſions</hi> and <hi>Words,</hi> as the <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of all <hi>Parties</hi> about this Matter, we ſhall find them well enough <hi>agreed</hi> in it at the bottom. And 'tis no wonder, if (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſeveral incidental <hi>Diſputes</hi>) they ſhould yet agree in the <hi>Main:</hi> Since the Experience of Mankind does eaſily teach us, <hi>what</hi> ſort of <hi>Perfection</hi> Human <hi>Nature</hi> is capable of; and what can, or can not, actually be attained by <hi>Man.</hi> The <hi>Pelagians</hi> did not contend for an <hi>Angelical Perfection,</hi> nor St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> deny <hi>ſuch</hi> a one as was truly <hi>ſuitable to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29455:21"/>
Man:</hi> the <hi>one</hi> could not be ſo far a Stranger to <hi>Human Nature,</hi> as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt it in Reality from thoſe Errors and Defects, which the beſt of Men complain of, and labour againſt. Nor was St. <hi>Austin</hi> ſo little acquainted with the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> and of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> as not to be well enough aſſured that Man might be <hi>Habitually</hi> Good; and that ſuch were influenced and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a firm Faith, and a fervent Love, and well grounded Hope. The <hi>Diſpute</hi> between Them then, concerning <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> did not conſiſt in <hi>This,</hi> whether Men might be <hi>Habitually</hi> good: This was in Reality <hi>acknowledg'd</hi> on <hi>Both</hi> ſides: Nor whether the beſt Men were ſubject to Defects, for <hi>This</hi> too, <hi>Both</hi> ſides could not but be ſenſible of, but in theſe <hi>two things</hi> eſpecially. <hi>Firſt, what</hi> was to be attributed to <hi>Grace, what</hi> to <hi>Nature?</hi> And this relates not to the <hi>Definition</hi> or <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Perfection,</hi> but to the <hi>Source</hi> and <hi>Origine</hi> of it. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> whether thoſe <hi>Irregular</hi> Motions, Defects and Errors, to which the beſt Men were ſubject, were to be accounted <hi>Sins</hi> or not? Neither the one ſide nor the other then, as far as I can diſcern,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29455:22"/>
did in truth miſtake the Nature of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Perfection:</hi> Each placed it in <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual</hi> Righteouſneſs; The one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for no <hi>more,</hi> nor did the other contend for <hi>leſs</hi> in the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man. And when the <hi>one</hi> aſſerted him free from <hi>Sin,</hi> he did not aſſert him free from <hi>Defects:</hi> And while the <hi>other</hi> would not allow the beſt Man to be without <hi>Sin,</hi> they did not by <hi>Sin</hi> underſtand any thing elſe, but ſuch <hi>Diſorders, Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions</hi> to, or <hi>Deviations</hi> from the Law of <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>Pelagian</hi> himſelf muſt needs own to be in the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man. The Diſpute then, was not <hi>what</hi> Man might, or might not attain to; for Both ſides agreed him capable of the ſame <hi>Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Righteouſneſs; Both ſides allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Him ſubject to the ſame <hi>Frailties:</hi> But <hi>one</hi> ſide would have theſe <hi>Frailties</hi> accounted <hi>Sins,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> would <hi>not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Numerous indeed have been the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies between the <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches</hi> about <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Counſel, Mortal</hi> and <hi>Venial</hi> Sin, the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of fulfilling the Law of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Merit</hi> of Good Works, and ſuch-like. But after all, if we enquire what that <hi>Height</hi> of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29455:22"/>
                  <hi>Virtue</hi> is to which the beſt of Men may arrive, what thoſe <hi>Frailties</hi> and <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi> are to which they are ſubject, 'twere I think eaſie to ſhew that the Wiſe and Good are on all hands <hi>agreed</hi> about this. Nor does it much concern my preſent purpoſe in what ſenſe, or on what account <hi>Papiſts</hi> think ſome ſins Venial, and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> deny them to be ſo; ſince neither the one nor the other, exempt the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man from <hi>Infirmities,</hi> nor aſſert any other <hi>Height</hi> or <hi>Perfection</hi> then what conſiſts in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate and well eſtabliſh'd <hi>Habit</hi> of Virtue. Some Men may, and do talk very extravagantly: But it is very hard to imagine, that Sober and Pious Men ſhould run in with them. <hi>Such,</hi> when they talk of <hi>Fulfilling</hi> the Law of <hi>God</hi> and keeping his Commandments, muſt ſurely underſtand this of the Law of <hi>God</hi> in a <hi>Gracious</hi> and <hi>Equitable</hi> ſenſe: And this is no more then what the <hi>Scripture</hi> aſſerts of every ſincere <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> When they talk of, I know not what tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant <hi>Perfection</hi> in <hi>Monkery,</hi> they muſt ſurely mean nothing more, then that Poverty, Chaſtity, and Obedience
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29455:23"/>
are <hi>Heroick</hi> Inſtances of Faith and Love, of Poverty of Spirit, and Purity of Heart; and that an <hi>Aſcetick</hi> Diſcipline is the moſt compendious and effectual way to a Conſummate <hi>Habit</hi> of Righteouſneſs. <hi>Finally,</hi> by the Diſtinction of <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Counſel,</hi> ſuch can never intend ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more then This, that we are obliged to <hi>ſome</hi> things under pain of Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to <hi>others,</hi> by the Hopes of greater Degrees of Glory: For 'tis not eaſie for me to comprehend, that any Man, whoſe Judgment is not enſlav'd to the Dictates of his <hi>Party,</hi> ſhould deny <hi>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of theſe <hi>two</hi> Truths. 1. That whatever is neither forbidden, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by any Law of God, is <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</hi> 2. That no Man can do more then love the <hi>Lord</hi> his <hi>God,</hi> with all his Heart, with all his Soul, and with all his Might, and his Neighbour as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

               <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> have made much noiſe and ſtir about the Doctrine of <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and have reflected very ſeverely on others, as ſubverting the great Deſign of our Redemption (which is Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from Sin) and upholding the Kingdom of Darkneſs: But with what <hi>Juſtice</hi> will eaſily appear when I have repreſented their <hi>Senſe,</hi> which I will

Believe they that faithfully wait for it, ſhall obtain it, and ſhall be preſented without Sin in the Image of the Father; And ſuch walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit, and are in Covenant with God, and their ſins are blotted out, and remembred no more; for they ceaſe to commit ſin, being Born of the Seed of God.</hi> If by <hi>Sin</hi> here, he means, as he ſeems to do, <hi>Deliberate</hi> or <hi>Preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Sin; I do not think any Eſtabliſh'd <hi>Church,</hi> whether <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>Popiſh,</hi> Teaches otherwiſe.

                  </note> goes very <hi>Methodically</hi> to work, and <hi>firſt</hi> ſets down the ſtate of the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>then</hi> confutes <hi>thoſe</hi> that differ from Him, anſwers their Objections out of <hi>Scripture;</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> eſtabliſhes his own Doctrine.

When to This I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he ſpeaks all along of <hi>That</hi> which we call <hi>Wilful Sin,</hi> as appears from his Deſcription of <hi>it;</hi> for he calls
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:29455:25"/>
it, <hi>Iniquity, Wickedneſs, Impurity,</hi> the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> and attributes ſuch Effects to it as belong not at all to what we call <hi>Sins</hi> of <hi>Infirmity;</hi> when I ſay <hi>This</hi> is added to render his Senſe <hi>clear,</hi> I can readily ſubſcribe to him: For I know no ſuch Doctrines in our <hi>Church</hi> as Thoſe which he there oppoſes; namely, that the <hi>Regenerate</hi> are to live in <hi>Sin,</hi> and that their <hi>Good Works</hi> are <hi>Impure</hi> and <hi>Sinful.</hi> But then, he either miſtakes the Main Point in Debate, or prudently declines it: For the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not, whether good Men may live in <hi>Mortal</hi> or <hi>Wilful Sin,</hi> but whether good Men are not ſubject to <hi>Frailties</hi> and <hi>Infirmities,</hi> which are indeed <hi>Sins</hi> though not <hi>imputable</hi> under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Grace.</hi> Whether the <hi>Quakers</hi> are not in this Point <hi>Pelagians,</hi> I do not now inquire; becauſe if they be, they are already conſidered. Two things there are in Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi>'s ſtate of the Queſtion, which I cannot ſo well approve of; the <hi>One</hi> is, that he expreſſes himſelf ſo injudiciouſly about the growth and improvement of his <hi>Perfect</hi> Man, that he ſeems to forget the Difference the <hi>Scriptures</hi> make between <hi>Babes</hi> and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29455:25"/>
full <hi>Grown</hi> Men in <hi>Christ,</hi> and to place Perfection ſo low in reference to <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Righteouſneſs, or Virtue, as if it conſiſted in <hi>Negative</hi> only, or ceaſing from Sin. The <hi>Other</hi> is, That though he does not peremptorily <hi>affirm</hi> a State of <hi>Impeccability</hi> attainable in this Life, yet he ſeems inclined to <hi>Believe</hi> it, and imagines it countenanced by 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. But he ought to have conſider'd, That whatever <hi>Impeccability</hi> may be inferr'd from that <hi>Text,</hi> it is attributed, not to ſome extraordinary Perſons, but to all whoſoever they be that are Born of <hi>God,</hi> but this is out of my way. All that I am to obſerve upon the whole is, that Theſe Men place <hi>Perfection</hi> eſpecially in refraining from <hi>Sin:</hi> I advance <hi>higher;</hi> and place it in a well-ſetled <hi>Habit</hi> of Righteouſneſs. And I believe they will be as little diſſatisfied with me for this, as I am with them, for aſſerting the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Man freed from Sin. For as Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> expreſſes himſelf, I think he has in reality no Adverſaries but <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Ranters.</hi>

               <p>As to That Perfection which is mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by <hi>Miſtical</hi> Writers, ſome of Them have only darken'd and obſcured
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29455:26"/>
the plain Senſe of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> by figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and unintelligible Terms. <hi>Thoſe</hi> of Them which write with more Life and Heat than other Men ordinarily do, recommend nothing but that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> which begins in the <hi>Fear,</hi> and is conſummate in the <hi>Love</hi> of God, which enlightens the Mind, purifies the Heart, and fixes and unites Man to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Good, that is <hi>God:</hi> And I am ſure I ſhall not differ with <hi>Theſe.</hi>

               <p>There are, I confeſs, almoſt innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſayings of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently teſtifie how little Friends they were to <hi>Perfection,</hi> in ſuch a Notion of it as is too generally embraced in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Primitive</hi> Spirit breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nothing but <hi>Humility:</hi> It was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Enemy to All ſelf-Confidence and Arrogance, to Supererogation and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and it invited Men earneſtly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Slips</hi> of Life, and on that <hi>Oppoſition</hi> which the Law of the <hi>Body</hi> maintains againſt the Law of the <hi>Mind,</hi> in ſome Degree or other, in the <hi>Beſt</hi> Men.

ſit vera,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>though our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe of that Love which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſheds abroad in our Hearts, be Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and Real, yet is it not abſolute and conſummate, becauſe of the Oppoſition of Concupiſcence: So that it is an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Duty of Chriſtianity, to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bewailing the Errors of Life. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are oblig'd humbly to confeſs with St.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>That our Righteouſneſs in this Life, conſiſts rather in the pardon of our Sins, then in the perfection of our Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi> All this is undoubtedly true, but concerns not me: I never Dream of any man's paſſing the Courſe of Life <hi>without Sin:</hi> Nor do I contend for ſuch a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> as St. <hi>Austin</hi> calls <hi>Abſolute,</hi> which will admit of no Increaſe, and is exempt from Defects and Errors. Though on the <hi>other</hi> hand, I confeſs I cannot but think, ſome carry this matter too far; and while they labour to abate the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> of man, give too much incouragement to <hi>Negligence</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</hi> I cannot ſee <hi>how</hi> frequent Relapſes into <hi>Deliberate</hi> Acts of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, can conſiſt with a well ſetl'd and eſtabliſh'd <hi>Habit</hi> of Goodneſs.

                  <hi>Implicite</hi> Faith for their <hi>Authority</hi> in others, has produced many <hi>unwary Expreſſions,</hi> and I doubt very <hi>unſound</hi> and pernicious <hi>Notions</hi> about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               <p>HAving in the <hi>two former</hi> Chapters fix'd the Notion of Religious <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and prov'd it conſonant to <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> and not ſo only, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo made it appear, that it is countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Unanimous <hi>Conſent</hi> of <hi>All,</hi> who have ever handled This Subject. I have nothing now to do, but by way of <hi>Inference,</hi> to repreſent the <hi>Advantages</hi> we may reap from it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is from hence plain, That <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> muſt not be placed in Fantaſtick Speculations, or Voluntary Obſervances, but in the ſolid and uſeful <hi>Virtues</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> in the Works of Faith, the Labour of Love, and the Patience of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:29455:27"/>
Hope; in the Purity and Humility of a Child of Light; in the Conſtancy and Magnanimity which becomes one who has brought the Body into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and has ſet his Affections on things above. <hi>This</hi> ſtate of <hi>Perfection</hi> is well enough deſcribed by the <hi>Rule</hi> of St. <hi>Bennet. Ergo his omnibus Humilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Gradibus aſcenſis, Monachus mox ad Charitatem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Monk having paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through theſe ſeveral Stages of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility or Mortification, will arrive at that Love of God which caſteth out fear; by which he will be enabled to perform all things with Eaſe and Pleaſure, and as it were Naturally, which before he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd with Reluctancy and Dread; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now moved and acted, not by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Hell, but by a delight in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the force of an excellent Habit: Both which, Chriſt by his Spirit Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes to increaſe and exalt in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant now cleans'd and purg'd from all Sin and Vice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This Notion of <hi>Perfection</hi> proves all Men to lie under an <hi>Obligation</hi> to it: For as All are <hi>capable</hi> of an <hi>Habit</hi> of Holineſs, ſo is it the Duty of All to <hi>endeavour</hi> after it. If <hi>Perfection</hi> were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29455:28"/>
indeed an <hi>Angelical</hi> State; if it did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in an Exemption from all Defects and Infirmities, and in ſuch an Elevation of Vertue, to which nothing can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; <hi>then</hi> I confeſs, all <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> of it, and much more all <hi>Attempts</hi> after it, would be vain and inſolent too. <hi>If</hi> again, it did conſiſt in ſome <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick</hi> Pitch of Vertue, which ſhould appear to have ſome thing ſo <hi>Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> in it, as ſhould make it look more like a <hi>Miracle</hi> than a <hi>Duty,</hi> it were <hi>then</hi> to be expected but once in an <hi>Age,</hi> from ſome <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Perſon, called to it by Peculiar <hi>Inſpirations,</hi> and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary <hi>Gifts.</hi> But if <hi>Chriſtian Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> be, as I have proved, only a well confirmed <hi>Habit</hi> of Goodneſs, if it differ from <hi>Sincerity</hi> only, when <hi>Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> is in its <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Infancy,</hi> not when <hi>grown</hi> up, then 'tis plain, that <hi>every Christian</hi> lies under an <hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>it.</hi> Accordingly the <hi>Scripture</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts All <hi>to perfect Holineſs in the fear of God, to go on to Perfection,</hi> Heb. 6. And it aſſigns This as one great end of the inſtitution of a ſtanding <hi>Miniſtry</hi> in the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> namely, <hi>the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Saints, the edifying the Body
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:29455:28"/>
of Chriſt, till we all come in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a Perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.12, 13. And hence it is, that we find the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> purſuing this great End, by their <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Labours,</hi> earneſtly contending and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to preſent all Chriſtians <hi>Perfect</hi> before <hi>God.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 3.10. <hi>Night and Day praying exceedingly, that we might ſee your face, and might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that which is lacking in your Faith.</hi> Col. 1.28. <hi>Whom we preach, warning every Man, and teaching every Man in all wiſdom, that we may preſent every Man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſee 1 Pet. 5.10. Coll. 4.13. Nay further, the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> frequently puts us in mind, that they are in a State of <hi>Danger,</hi> who do not <hi>proceed</hi> and <hi>grow</hi> in Grace, and preſs on towards <hi>Perfection.</hi> Now all this is very eaſily accountable, taking <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> for a well ſetled <hi>Habit</hi> of Holineſs; but on no <hi>other</hi> Notion of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Account of <hi>Perfection</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves <hi>Thoſe Scruples</hi> which are often ſtarted about the <hi>Degrees</hi> of Holineſs and <hi>Meaſures</hi> of Duty, and are wont
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29455:29"/>
to diſturb the Peace, clog the Vigour, and damp the Alacrity of many well Meaning and Good People. Nay, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Acute Parts and Good Learning, are often puzled about this Matter: Some teaching that Man is not bound to do his beſt; others on the quite contrary; that he is ſo far bound to it, that he is always oblig'd to <hi>purſue</hi> the moſt <hi>Perfect Duty,</hi> to <hi>chooſe</hi> the moſt <hi>Perfect</hi> Means, and to exert the <hi>utmoſt</hi> of that <hi>Strength,</hi> and act according to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> of that <hi>Capacity</hi> with which God has endowed him. Now all theſe things, when we come to apply theſe <hi>General</hi> Doctrines to <hi>Particular</hi> Inſtances, and a vaſt variety of <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> have ſo much <hi>Latitude,</hi> Ambiguity, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in them, that Men of <hi>Tender</hi> Conſciences, and <hi>Defective</hi> Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reap nothing from ſuch high flown <hi>Indefinite</hi> Diſcourſes, but <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Scruples.</hi> It requires a Strong and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating Judgment, to reſolve what is the utmoſt <hi>Extent</hi> of our Power and Capacity; <hi>What</hi> the <hi>beſt</hi> Mean, and what the <hi>moſt Perfect</hi> Duty, when <hi>many</hi> preſent themſelves to us, and all <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi> circumſtantiated. But now, as I
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29455:29"/>
have ſtated Matters, we are bound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to purſue and labour after <hi>Growth</hi> and <hi>Improvement</hi> in the Love of God, and Charity towards our Neighbour, in Purity, Humility, and the like. And this we ſhall certainly do, if we be <hi>Sincere;</hi> in other Matters we are left to our <hi>Prudence;</hi> and if the Error of our <hi>Choice</hi> proceed only from an Error in <hi>Judgment,</hi> not a <hi>Corruption</hi> in our <hi>Hearts,</hi> we are <hi>ſafe</hi> enough.</p>
               <p n="4">4. 'Tis very eaſie to <hi>diſcern</hi> now <hi>where</hi> we ſtand in reference to <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> how <hi>remote</hi> we are from it, or how <hi>near</hi> to it. For the <hi>nature</hi> of an <hi>Habit</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plain and Intelligible, the <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of it, obvious to the Meaneſt Capacity, 'tis <hi>eaſie</hi> to determine upon an Impartial <hi>Examination,</hi> whether we be <hi>Habitually</hi> Good or not, or what <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches</hi> we have made towards it. And becauſe this is a Matter of no ſmall <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,</hi> and Men are generally back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enough to advance too far into ſuch <hi>Reflections</hi> and <hi>Applications,</hi> as may breed any <hi>Diſturbance</hi> to their <hi>Peace,</hi> or any <hi>Diminution</hi> of their Good <hi>Opinion</hi> for <hi>themſelves,</hi> though neither the one nor the other be too well grounded; I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:29455:30"/>
ſhall not think my time miſpent, if I here take this task upon me; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by ſeveral <hi>Particular</hi> deductions, to lay every Man's <hi>State</hi> as plainly open to his <hi>View</hi> as I can.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. Then, from the Notion I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of <hi>Perfection,</hi> it appears, That <hi>if</hi> a Man's Life be very <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neven,</hi> Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and Contradictory to it ſelf, if he be to day a <hi>Saint,</hi> and to morrow a <hi>Sinner,</hi> if he yield to day to the Motives of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and Impulſes of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and to morrow to the Sollicitations of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and Temptations of the <hi>World,</hi> he is far from being <hi>Perfect;</hi> ſo far, that there is not ground enough to conclude Him <hi>Sincere</hi> or <hi>Real,</hi> though <hi>Imperfect</hi> Convert. The only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Proof of <hi>Regeneration</hi> is Victory; <hi>he that is born of God over-cometh the World,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4. <hi>Faith,</hi> though it be <hi>True,</hi> is not preſently <hi>Saving</hi> and <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> till it have ſubdued the <hi>Will,</hi> and captivated the <hi>Heart, i. e.</hi> till we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to <hi>Live</hi> by <hi>Faith;</hi> which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from <hi>That</hi> Corn in the <hi>Parable,</hi> which though it ſhot up yet had it not <hi>Depth</hi> of Earth, nor <hi>Root</hi> enough, and therefore was <hi>withered</hi> up, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29455:30"/>
brought forth <hi>no</hi> fruit. Regret and Sorrow for Sin is an Excellent Paſſion, but till it has ſubdued our Corruptions, chang'd our Affections, and purified our Hearts, 'tis not that <hi>Saving</hi> Repentance in the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Godly ſorrow worketh Repentance, not to be repented of.</hi> We may have ſome ſudden Heats and Paſſions for Vertue, but if they be too ſhort liv'd to implant it in us, this is <hi>not</hi> that <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> which animates and impregnates the New Creature mentioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Faith working by Love.</hi> Laſtly, we may have good Purpoſes, Intentions, nay, Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but if theſe prove too weak to obtain a <hi>Conqueſt</hi> over our <hi>Corruptions,</hi> if they prove too weak to reſiſt the <hi>Temptations</hi> we were wont to fall by, 'tis plain that they are not ſuch as can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate us <hi>Righteous,</hi> or entitle us to a <hi>Crown,</hi> which is promiſed to him that <hi>overcometh.</hi> And here I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, to how little purpoſe <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> have been multiplied about the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification</hi> of Man. 'Tis <hi>one</hi> thing for <hi>God</hi> to <hi>juſtifie</hi> us, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>Pardon</hi> our <hi>Sins,</hi> and account us <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>his</hi> Children; and <hi>another</hi> for us to <hi>know,</hi> or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29455:31"/>
be <hi>aſſured</hi> that he does ſo. If we enquire after the <hi>former,</hi> 'tis plain to me, that no Man can be <hi>accounted</hi> Righteous by <hi>God,</hi> till he really <hi>is</hi> ſo: And when the Man is <hi>Sanctified</hi> throughout in Spirit, Soul, and Body; then is he certainly <hi>Juſtified,</hi> and not till then. And this I think is confeſſed by all, except <hi>Antinomians;</hi> and whatever <hi>Difference</hi> there is amongſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in this Matter, it lies in the Forms and Variety of <hi>Expreſſion.</hi> They that contend earneſtly for the Neceſſity of <hi>Good works,</hi> do not, I ſuppoſe, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the <hi>Works</hi> are Holy, before the <hi>Heart</hi> is ſo; for as is the <hi>Fountain,</hi> ſuch will be its <hi>Streams,</hi> as is the <hi>Tree,</hi> ſuch will be its <hi>Fruits.</hi> What Abſurdity then is there in admitting that Men are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before they bring forth Good Works; if they cannot bring forth Good Works till they be Sanctified and Chang'd? On the other hand, they who contend ſo earneſtly for <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Works,</hi> do not only ſuppoſe that the Man is throughly changed, by the <hi>Infuſion</hi> of <hi>Habitual Grace,</hi> but alſo that this <hi>Grace,</hi> as ſoon as it has opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will exert and expreſs it ſelf in <hi>good Works:</hi> And they do readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29455:31"/>
that the <hi>Faith</hi> which does <hi>not</hi> work by <hi>Love,</hi> is an <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated <hi>Faith.</hi> And if ſo, how natural is it to compriſe in that Holineſs which <hi>juſtifies,</hi> not only the change of the <hi>Heart,</hi> but of the <hi>Actions?</hi> But here I think it is well worth the conſidering, whether that thorough <hi>Change</hi> in the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of a Sinner, which is called <hi>Holineſs,</hi> be now effected at <hi>once,</hi> and in a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and not rather <hi>gradually</hi> and in <hi>time?</hi> For this may give ſome light to the Doctrine of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and draws off from Speculations and Theories, to more Uſeful and Practical Thoughts and Diſcourſes about it. 'Tis true, in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of a Sinner was wrought by a dazling light, by Surpriſing Miracles, by Exuberant Influxes of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the Concurrence of many extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things, <hi>Sanctification</hi> (as in the <hi>Goaler</hi> and his <hi>Family,</hi> Act. 16.) might be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun</hi> and <hi>finiſhed</hi> in the <hi>ſame</hi> hour. But I doubt it is <hi>rarely</hi> ſo with us at <hi>this</hi> day; our Vices are not ſo ſuddenly ſubdued, nor our Vertues ſo ſuddenly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted. <hi>Our</hi> Convictions in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Converſion, are ſeldom ſo
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29455:32"/>
full and clear as <hi>Theirs:</hi> And if we may judge by the <hi>Effects,</hi> 'tis but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that the Principle of a New Life is infus'd in the <hi>ſame</hi> Plenty and Power it appears to have been in <hi>Them.</hi> And if ſo, then theſe things will follow; 1. Though in the firſt <hi>Plantation</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Men being converted, as it were in a <hi>Moment,</hi> ingrafted by <hi>Baptiſm</hi> into <hi>Christ,</hi> and receiving the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the <hi>Earneſt</hi> of their <hi>Justification</hi> or Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with <hi>God,</hi> and their future <hi>Glory:</hi> We may very well ſay of them, that they were not only <hi>Juſtified,</hi> but alſo <hi>knew</hi> themſelves to be ſo, <hi>before</hi> they had brought forth any other <hi>Fruit</hi> of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, than what was implied in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> of themſelves to <hi>Christ</hi> by that ſolemn Rite of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> but at <hi>this</hi> day, when Converſion is not effected in the ſame manner; when Faith and Good Works do mutually cheriſh one another, when Righteouſneſs is not brought forth into victory, but by <hi>long</hi> labour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; I ſee not why <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Good Works</hi> may not be pronounced <hi>jointly</hi> and <hi>antecedently</hi> neceſſary to our <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> 2. The Doctrine of <hi>Infuſed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29455:32"/>
Habits</hi> has been much ridiculed and expoſed, as abſurd by ſome Men; and I muſt confeſs, if it be <hi>Eſſential</hi> to a <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> to be acquired by length of time, and repetition of the ſame Acts, then an <hi>Infus'd Habit</hi> is a very <hi>Odd</hi> Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: But why <hi>God</hi> cannot produce in us thoſe ſtrong Diſpoſitions to Vertue in a <hi>Moment,</hi> which are <hi>naturally</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>Time;</hi> or why <hi>we</hi> may not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe as much efficacy to <hi>Infus'd Grace,</hi> as <hi>Philoſophers</hi> are wont to do to <hi>repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Acts,</hi> I cannot ſee? Nor can I ſee why ſuch <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> when <hi>Infus'd,</hi> may not be called <hi>Habits,</hi> if they have all the <hi>Properties</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of an Habit. And that ſuch excellent Diſpoſitions <hi>were</hi> on a ſudden wrought in the Minds of Chriſtians in the beginning of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, is too plain from the Hiſtory of thoſe times to need a proof. But whether ſuch Changes are ordinarily effected ſo ſuddenly at <hi>this</hi> day, we have much reaſon to <hi>doubt;</hi> nay, I think it appears from what I have ſaid, there is ſufficient reaſon to <hi>deny</hi> it. And if ſo, the <hi>Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of <hi>Habits</hi> cannot be ſo properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on <hi>now</hi> as <hi>then;</hi> and <hi>we</hi> may be more ſubject to make <hi>unwarrantable</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29455:33"/>
from the Doctrine of <hi>Infus'd Habits,</hi> then <hi>they</hi> were in thoſe bright and <hi>Miraculous</hi> days. 3. As our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs</hi> to <hi>Sanctification</hi> muſt be <hi>ſlower</hi> then formerly, as it muſt be <hi>longer</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Grace that is infus'd ſo far, maſter our corruption, and dilate and diffuſe it ſelf through our whole Nature, as that we may juſtly be denominated <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Righteous</hi> from the prevalence of this Holy Principle: So by a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſequence, our <hi>Juſtification</hi> muſt commence <hi>later.</hi> But after all, I know not why we ſhould be ſo inquiſitive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>time</hi> of our <hi>Justification</hi> by <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>Comfort</hi> of a Chriſtian does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult immediately from <hi>God's Juſtifying</hi> him, but from <hi>his knowing</hi> that he does ſo. And if this be the thing we are now ſearching after, namely, what rational <hi>Aſſurance</hi> we can have of our <hi>Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and when, as indeed it is; then, though I do not pretend to determine, that Man <hi>is</hi> not, or <hi>may</hi> not be Juſtifi'd or account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed righteous by <hi>God,</hi> upon a thorough change of Mind or Soul, before this change <hi>diſcovers</hi> it ſelf in a Series of <hi>Victories</hi> over thoſe <hi>Temptations</hi> by which he was led <hi>Captive</hi> before; Yet
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29455:33"/>
I aſſert <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the true and ſolid proof of the <hi>Sanctification</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> is <hi>Sanctity</hi> of Life. <hi>Next,</hi> when I talk of <hi>Victory,</hi> I ſuppoſe Man <hi>engag'd,</hi> I ſuppoſe him <hi>encountred</hi> by <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>Enemies;</hi> and <hi>then</hi> I affirm, that the <hi>Faith</hi> which is not ſtrong enough to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi> is not ſtrong enough to <hi>Juſtifie;</hi> if any Man demand, may not that Faith which is Foil'd to <hi>day,</hi> Conquer to <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;</hi> I anſwer, I muſt leave this to <hi>God:</hi> I can pronounce nothing of the <hi>Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the Heart, but by the outward <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment</hi> and <hi>Succeſs.</hi> And if this be the proper way of judging of a Man's Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I am ſure I may with much more confidence affirm, that nothing leſs then <hi>Victory</hi> can be a clear Argument of <hi>Perfection.</hi> My buſineſs therefore ſhall ever be to be <hi>Holy,</hi> and then I'm <hi>ſure</hi> I ſhall be <hi>Justified.</hi> If I <hi>be</hi> Holy, <hi>God</hi> who cannot err will certainly <hi>account</hi> me ſo; and if I <hi>ceaſe</hi> to <hi>be</hi> ſo, <hi>God</hi> muſt <hi>ceaſe</hi> to <hi>account</hi> me ſo. And this is all which I deſign by this long Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph: That is, to render Men more careful and diligent in making their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Election ſure, and to prevent Preſumption and groundleſs Confidence.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29455:34"/>
And that nothing that I have here <hi>ſaid,</hi> may be perverted to a <hi>contrary</hi> purpoſe; that no Man from ſome paſſionate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or ſudden changes of his own Mind, may be tempted to conclude too <hi>haſtily</hi> of his being <hi>Justified,</hi> as if the change wrought in him, were equal to that commonly effected in the <hi>firſt</hi> Converts of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> I think it not amiſs to put ſuch a one in mind, that even <hi>Theſe</hi> were not Juſtified, unleſs they did <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Christ</hi> with the <hi>Mouth</hi> as well as <hi>Believe</hi> in him with the <hi>Heart;</hi> and that this <hi>publick</hi> Profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in <hi>thoſe</hi> days, was equivalent to <hi>many</hi> Good Works in <hi>Theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2dly, He that feels in himſelf little or no Fervency of Spirit, little or no Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Thirſt after Righteouſneſs, has reaſon to ſuſpect, that his <hi>Regularity</hi> is little more then common <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Civility,</hi> and to doubt, leſt his <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> be nothing elſe but <hi>Cuſtom</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Prudence.</hi> I ſee not <hi>how</hi> ſo much <hi>Indifference</hi> and <hi>Sluggiſhneſs</hi> can conſiſt with a firm <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Expectation</hi> of a <hi>Crown,</hi> with a ſincere <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> But if we may ſuppoſe ſuch a one reſtrained from Evil, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29455:34"/>
preſerved in the way of Duty, after a ſort, by the <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and a <hi>Deſire</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> yet certainly this can be but the <hi>Infancy</hi> of the <hi>New Creature</hi> at moſt: And the beſt advice that can be given ſuch a one, is ſurely that of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that by <hi>adding one degree of Vertue to another, he would uſe all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make his Calling and Election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, If a Man's Religion produce very <hi>few</hi> Good Works, or ſuch only as put him to little travel or expence, we may conclude, that this Man is not <hi>Perfect;</hi> his Charity is too weak, too narrow to be that of an <hi>exalted</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: The beſt that we can think of ſuch a one is, That he is yet taken up in the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of <hi>Mortification,</hi> that he is <hi>contending</hi> with his <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> which are not yet ſo far reduc'd, ſo far ſubdu'd and brought under, as to leave him in a State of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and in a capacity of <hi>extending</hi> and <hi>enlarging</hi> his <hi>Charity.</hi> This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the <hi>Inconſiderableneſs</hi> of our Good Works is reaſon enough to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, not only one's <hi>Perfection,</hi> but <hi>Sincerity,</hi> holds good in <hi>ſuch</hi> Caſes only,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29455:35"/>
where neither the <hi>Opportunity</hi> nor <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi> of higher and nobler Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is wanting. I dare not pronounce that no Man can be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> unleſs he be fit to be a <hi>Martyr:</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>loweſt</hi> degree of <hi>Sincerity</hi> muſt imply a purpoſe and <hi>Reſolution</hi> of Univerſal <hi>Obedience,</hi> in Defiance of all Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but yet <hi>That</hi> Grace, for ought I can prove to the contrary, may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to <hi>Save</hi> a Man, that is, ſufficient to maſter the Difficulties <hi>he</hi> is to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with, although he ſhould not be to grapple with the Diſtempers and Tryals to which the Body and the State of <hi>another</hi> Man may be ſubject. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Wiſdom and the Faithfulneſs of God can be no further concern'd, then to qualifie any one for the diſcharge of <hi>thoſe</hi> duties which he thinks fit to <hi>call</hi> him to: And if the diſcharge of ſuch duties be not a ſufficient Proof of our Sincerity, we can never have any, but muſt be always held in ſuſpence and torture about our future State. I ſee no reaſon to queſtion, but that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Lord were in a State of <hi>Grace</hi> before the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and the following <hi>Pentecoſt:</hi> And yet I think I
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29455:35"/>
have plain Reaſon to believe, that they were not fit to be <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confeſſors</hi> till then; the <hi>Grace</hi> they had <hi>before</hi> might, I doubt it not, have enabled them to live <hi>Virtuouſly</hi> amidſt <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Ordinary</hi> Temptations: But it was neceſſary that they ſhould be endow'd with <hi>Power</hi> from on <hi>High,</hi> before they could be fit to encounter thoſe <hi>fiery Tryals,</hi> to which the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was to expoſe them. To this ſurely our Maſter refers, when he tells the <hi>Phariſees, That the Children of the Bride-Chamber were not to faſt while the Bride-groom was with them:</hi> when he tells <hi>his</hi> Diſciples, <hi>I have many things to ſay, but you cannot bear them yet:</hi> when he asked the Sons of <hi>Zebedee. Are ye able to drink of the Cup that I ſhall drink of, and to be baptized with the Baptiſm that I am baptized with,</hi> Matth. 20.21? If this be true Divinity, as I am (I had almoſt ſaid,) confident it is, then I am confident, that which requires very <hi>unaccountable</hi> Teſts of a Man's <hi>Sincerity,</hi> is very <hi>extravagant.</hi> For example, when Men talk at this rate, that a Sincere Chriſtian ſhould have ſuch an <hi>Abhorrence</hi> for <hi>Sin,</hi> as to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29455:36"/>
fear <hi>Guilt</hi> more then its <hi>Puniſhment:</hi> Such a <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as rather then offend Him, to be content to Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and Plunge himſelf into the Jaws, not of <hi>Death,</hi> like the Martyrs, but of <hi>Hell</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, If the Duties of Religion be very <hi>troubleſome</hi> and <hi>uneaſie</hi> to a Man, we may from hence conclude, that he is not <hi>Perfect:</hi> For though the <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of Wiſdom and Vertue be general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>harſh</hi> and <hi>ſevere</hi> to the <hi>Fool</hi> and <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> yet to him that has <hi>Conquered,</hi> the Yoke of Chriſt is <hi>eaſie,</hi> and his Burden <hi>light, to him that is filled with the Love of God, his Commandments are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous;</hi> hence is that obſervation of the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> Ecclus. 4.17, 18. <hi>For at the firſt ſhe will walk with him by crooked ways, and bring fear and dread upon him, and torment him with her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, until ſhe may truſt his Soul and try him by her Laws, then will ſhe return the ſtraight way unto him, and comfort him, and ſhew him her ſecrets.</hi> The reaſon of this Aſſertion is palpable, it is the nature of an <hi>Habit</hi> to render <hi>difficult</hi> Things <hi>eaſie, harſh</hi> Things <hi>pleaſant,</hi> to <hi>fix</hi> a <hi>floating</hi> and <hi>uncertain</hi> Humour, to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:29455:36"/>
Nurſe and Ripen a weak and tender <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> into <hi>Nature.</hi> And 'tis as reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to expect theſe effects in <hi>Religious,</hi> as in any <hi>other</hi> ſorts of <hi>Habits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He who does not find <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> full of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> who does not <hi>Glory</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>rejoyce</hi> in our <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> he who is not filled with an humble <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of the <hi>Divine Favour,</hi> and a Joyful <hi>expectation</hi> of <hi>Immortality</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> does yet <hi>want</hi> ſomething, he is yet <hi>defective,</hi> with reſpect, either to the <hi>brightneſs</hi> of <hi>Illumination,</hi> the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſs</hi> of <hi>Liberty,</hi> or <hi>the Ardor</hi> of <hi>Love;</hi> he may be a <hi>Good</hi> Man, and have gone a <hi>great</hi> way in his Chriſtian <hi>Race;</hi> but there is ſome thing ſtill behind to <hi>Compleat</hi> and <hi>Perfect</hi> him; ſome <hi>Error</hi> or other creates him groundleſs <hi>Scruples,</hi> ſome <hi>Incumbrance</hi> or <hi>Impediment</hi> or other, whether an Infelicity of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or the Incommodiouſneſs of his Circumſtances, or a little too warm an Application towards ſomething of the World, <hi>retards</hi> his <hi>Vigour</hi> and <hi>abates</hi> his <hi>Affections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have now finiſhed all that I can think neceſſary to form a general <hi>Idea</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <hi>Perfection:</hi> For I have not only
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:29455:37"/>
given a plain <hi>Definition</hi> or <hi>Deſcription</hi> of it, and <hi>Confirm'd</hi> and <hi>Fortified</hi> that Deſcription by <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>currant Senſe</hi> of <hi>all Sides</hi> and <hi>Parties,</hi> but have alſo by various <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,</hi> deduc'd from the <hi>General</hi> Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Perfection,</hi> precluded all ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Pretenſions to it,</hi> and enabled Men to ſee how <hi>far</hi> they are <hi>removed</hi> and <hi>diſtant</hi> from it, or how <hi>near</hi> they <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> it.

               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth</hi> I will <hi>now</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of, and that the more <hi>largely,</hi> becauſe as to <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> it is the <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of that <hi>Pleaſure</hi> which is the richeſt <hi>Ingredient</hi> of Human <hi>Happineſs</hi> in <hi>this</hi> Life.

which is the <hi>fourth</hi> Fruit of <hi>Perfection,</hi> it is the very <hi>thing</hi> for the ſake of which, I have <hi>ingag'd</hi> in my <hi>preſent</hi> ſubject.

The <hi>ſecond,</hi> am I <hi>aſſured</hi> that I ſhall <hi>continue</hi> ſo to my Life's <hi>end?</hi> To begin with the <hi>firſt,</hi> the Anſwer of this Enquiry depends on <hi>three</hi> Grounds.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Divine <hi>Revelation,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in General, <hi>who</hi> ſhall be <hi>Saved;</hi>

namely, They <hi>who Believe</hi> and <hi>Repent.</hi> Nor does any <hi>Sect</hi> doubt but that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, are the Indiſpenſable <hi>Conditions</hi> of Life. 'Tis true, the Notion of <hi>Repentance</hi> is miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably <hi>perverted</hi> by <hi>ſome,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> by <hi>others:</hi> But what remedy is there againſt the Luſts and Paſſions of Men? The <hi>Scripture</hi> does not only <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire</hi> Repentance and Faith, but it <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains</hi> and <hi>deſcribes</hi> the Nature of <hi>Both,</hi> by ſuch Conſpicuous and Infallible <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,</hi> that no Man <hi>can</hi> be Miſtaken in theſe <hi>two</hi> Points, <hi>but</hi> his Error muſt be owing to ſome Criminal <hi>Prejudices</hi> or <hi>Inclinations</hi> that Byaſs and pervert him. <hi>Good</hi> Men have ever been <hi>agreed</hi> in theſe Matters: And Catholick <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is no where more <hi>uncontroulable</hi> then here; the General Doctrine of all <hi>Ages</hi> hath been, and in <hi>this</hi> ſtill is, that by <hi>Repentance</hi> we are to underſtand a <hi>New Nature</hi> and <hi>New Life:</hi> And by <hi>Faith,</hi> when diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Repentance</hi> (as it ſometimes is in <hi>Scripture</hi>) a <hi>Reliance</hi> upon the <hi>Mercy</hi> of <hi>God</hi> through the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> and <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement</hi> of <hi>his</hi> Blood. <hi>Heaven</hi> lies open to all that perform theſe <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Ground of aſſurance as it relates to our preſent State, is an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of the Condition of Life laid down in the Goſpel to a Man's own <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Caſe, thus; <hi>They</hi> that <hi>Believe</hi> and <hi>Repent</hi> ſhall be <hi>Saved; I Believe</hi> and

                  <hi>Repent,</hi> therefore <hi>I</hi> ſhall be <hi>Saved.</hi> Now that a Man upon an <hi>Examination</hi> of himſelf, may be throughly <hi>aſſured</hi> that he <hi>does</hi> Believe and Repent, is evident from <hi>Scripture,</hi> which does not only <hi>exhort</hi> us to enter upon this <hi>Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but alſo aſſert, that <hi>Aſſurance, Joy,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> are the natural <hi>Fruits</hi> of it: But <hi>let a Man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread and drink of that Cup,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.28. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the Faith, prove your own ſelves: Know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be Reprobates?</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>But Sanctifie the Lord God in your Hearts, and be ready always to give an anſwer to every Man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope,</hi> that <hi>is in you with meekneſs and fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.15. <hi>And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments;</hi> 1 Joh. 2.3. <hi>Beloved, if our Hearts condemn us not,</hi> then <hi>have we confidence towards God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. 'Tis true, Men do often <hi>deceive</hi> themſelves, and entertain a more favourable Opinion of their ſtate then they ought. But <hi>whence</hi> proceeds this?

                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:29455:40"/>
Reflections on themſelves, or <hi>none</hi> at all. And therefore the Apoſtle teaches us plainly, that the only way to correct this Error, is a <hi>Sincere</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> ſearch into our ſelves: <hi>For if a Man think himſelf to be ſomething, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himſelf: But let every Man prove his own Work, and then ſhall he have rejoycing in himſelf alone, and not in another,</hi> Gal. 6.3, 4.

this I <hi>Anſwer.

Fruit of <hi>Grace,</hi> it is impoſſible we ſhould abound in the <hi>one</hi> without being poſſeſſed with the <hi>other.</hi> One would think now, that there ſhould be nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needful to eſtabliſh the <hi>Conſolation</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and yet <hi>God</hi> out of regard, no doubt, to the vaſt <hi>Importance</hi> and happy <hi>Influence</hi> of <hi>Aſſurance</hi> has furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with <hi>another</hi> ground of it, which is,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Laſt,</hi> namely, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> This Spirit, as it <hi>aſſiſts</hi> us in our <hi>Examination,</hi> ſo it <hi>ratifies</hi> and <hi>confirms</hi> our Sentence by its <hi>ſuffrage; fortifying</hi> our <hi>aſſurance</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing</hi> our <hi>Joy.</hi> All this the <hi>Scripture</hi> expreſly teaches us; for the Spirit is called <hi>The earneſt of our Inheritance, the Seal of our Redemption,</hi> Eph. 1.13, 14. Eph. 4.30, 31. 2 Cor. 2.10. 2 Cor. 5.

Yet are there Texts enough which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us, that the Spirit of God ſhould be imparted to believers through all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages, and that this ſhould be one effect of it to comfort us, and be a pledge to us of the Divine Favour, thus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and Rom. 8.15, 16. <hi>For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father; the Spirit it ſelf beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with our Spirit, that we are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and if Children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joynt heirs with Chriſt.</hi> If it be here demanded <hi>what</hi> this <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is, I anſwer, 'tis a Powerful <hi>Energy</hi> of <hi>the</hi> bleſſed <hi>Spirit, ſhedding abroad</hi> and encreaſing <hi>the Love of God in our Hearts,</hi> Rom. 5. <hi>Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worketh Patience, Patience Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Experience Hope, and Hope makes not aſhamed; becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our Hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

the <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance;</hi> another to ballance the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of it. For it is very poſſible that <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> may be ſtronger, where the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of it may not be ſo clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as where the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> is leſs. Thus for <hi>Example;</hi> the evidence of <hi>Senſe</hi> ſeems to moſt learned Men to be ſtronger then <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Faith:</hi> And yet through the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> a Man may embrace a Truth that depends upon <hi>Revelation,</hi> with as much <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> as one depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Senſe.</hi> And ſo it may be in the caſe of <hi>Aſſurance:</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> may by its Concurrence raiſe our <hi>Aſſurance</hi> as high as he pleaſes; although the <hi>Reaſon</hi> on which it be built, ſhould not be <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible,</hi> but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Moral,</hi> and ſubject at leaſt to a <hi>poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of Error. But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why ſhould not the <hi>certainty</hi> I have concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my <hi>Preſent State,</hi> be as Divine and Infallible, as that I have concerning an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith?</hi> If the <hi>Premiſes</hi> be Infallible, why ſhould not the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion?</hi> He that <hi>Believes and Repents is in a State of Grace,</hi> is a Divine an Infallible Propoſition: and why may
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:29455:47"/>
not this other. <hi>I Believe and Repent,</hi> be equally Infallible, though not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Divine? <hi>What</hi> Faith and Repentance is, is <hi>revealed;</hi> and therefore there is no room for my being here <hi>miſtaken:</hi> Beſides, I am <hi>aſſiſted</hi> and <hi>guided</hi> in the Tryal of my Self by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> So that the truth of this Propoſition, <hi>I Believe and Repent,</hi> depends <hi>partly</hi> upon the evidence of <hi>Senſe;</hi> and I may be as <hi>ſure</hi> of it, as of what I <hi>do</hi> or leave <hi>undone: partly</hi> upon the evidence of <hi>inward Senſation,</hi> or my <hi>Conſciouſneſs</hi> of my own Thoughts; and I may be as <hi>ſure</hi> of it as I can be of what I <hi>love</hi> or <hi>hate, rejoyce</hi> or <hi>grieve</hi> for: And laſtly, it depends upon the evidence of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which <hi>aſſiſts</hi> me in the <hi>Examination</hi> of my Self according to thoſe Characters of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which he hath himſelf revealed. And when <hi>I conclude</hi> from the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Propoſitions, that <hi>I am in a State of Grace, he</hi> confirms and ratifies my <hi>Inference.</hi> And now, let any one tell me, what kind of <hi>certainty</hi> that is, that can be greater than <hi>this?</hi> I have taken this pains to ſet the Doctrine of <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> in a clear Light, becauſe it is the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29455:48"/>
great Spring of the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man's <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> the ſource of his <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi> And this puts me in mind of that <hi>other</hi> fruit of <hi>Perfection,</hi> which in the beginning of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> I promiſed to inſiſt on, which is,
<q>Its Subſerviency to our Happineſs in this Life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Happineſs</hi> increaſes in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Perfection,</hi> cannot be denied, unleſs we will at the ſame time deny the Happineſs of a Man, to exceed <hi>that</hi> of an Infant, or the Happineſs of an Angel <hi>that</hi> of Man. Now <hi>this</hi> truth being of a very great <hi>Importance,</hi> and ſerving ſingly inſtead of a thouſand <hi>Motives</hi> to <hi>Perfection,</hi> I will conſider it impartially, and as cloſely as I can. <hi>Happineſs</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> are generally thought to be only two words for the ſame thing: Nor is this very remote from truth; for let but <hi>Pleaſure</hi> be ſolid and laſting, and I cannot ſee what more is wanting to make Man <hi>Happy.</hi> The beſt way therefore, to determin how much <hi>Perfection</hi> contributes to our <hi>Happineſs,</hi> is to examin how much it contributes to our <hi>Pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:29455:48"/>If with the <hi>Epicurean,</hi> we think <hi>Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> our ſupream <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and define <hi>Pleaſure</hi> by the <hi>abſence of Pain,</hi> then I am ſure the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man will have the beſt claim to it. <hi>He</hi> ſurely is freeſt from the Miſtakes and Errors, from the Paſſions and Follies, that embroil Human Life: he creates no evil to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor provokes any unneceſſary dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. His <hi>Vertue</hi> effectually <hi>does that</hi> which <hi>Atheiſm</hi> attempts in vain; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels the terror of an inviſible Power: he needs not drown the Voice of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience by Wine, or Noiſe, or the toil of Life; it ſpeaks nothing to him, but what is kind and obliging; it is his Comforter, not his Perſecutor: And as to this World, he reaps that ſatisfaction and tranquility from the <hi>Moderation</hi> of his Affections, which <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> do in vain promiſe themſelves from <hi>Preferments</hi> or the <hi>increaſe</hi> of <hi>Wealth.</hi> If therefore there were <hi>any</hi> ſtate on this ſide Heaven exempt from <hi>Evil,</hi> it muſt be <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man. But he <hi>knows</hi> the World too well to flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the expectation of <hi>Indolence,</hi> or an <hi>undisturb'd</hi> tranquility here <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;</hi> and is as far from being <hi>deluded</hi>

by vain <hi>Hopes,</hi> as from being <hi>ſcar'd</hi> by vain <hi>fears,</hi> or tortur'd and diſtended by vain <hi>deſires.</hi> He <hi>knows</hi> the World has its <hi>Evils,</hi> and that they cannot wholly be <hi>avoided;</hi> he <hi>knows</hi> it, and dares <hi>behold</hi> them with open Eyes, <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> their Force, and <hi>feel</hi> and <hi>try</hi> their Edge. And then when he has collected his <hi>own</hi> ſtrength, and called in the <hi>Aid</hi> of Heaven, he <hi>ſhrinks</hi> not, nor <hi>deſponds;</hi> but <hi>meets</hi> Evil with that <hi>Courage,</hi> and <hi>bears</hi> it with that <hi>evenneſs</hi> of Mind, that <hi>he</hi> ſeems even in his <hi>Afflictions</hi> nearer to <hi>Indolence,</hi> then the <hi>Fool</hi> and <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> in his <hi>Proſperity.</hi> So that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear profeſſing, there appears ſo much <hi>Beauty,</hi> ſo much <hi>lovelineſs</hi> in the deportment of the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the <hi>Evils</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> that for <hi>that</hi> reaſon alone, were there no <hi>other,</hi> I ſhould admire and prefer his <hi>Vertue</hi> above any <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> or <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of Life. Give me leave to <hi>compare</hi> the Saint and Sinner on this occaſion; and but very briefly. <hi>The wiſe Man's eyes,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 2.14. <hi>are in his head; but the fool walks in darkneſs:</hi> The wiſe Man ſees that he has Enemies, I mean Evils; and therefore he informs
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:29455:49"/>
himſelf well of their Strength, obſerves their Motion, and prepares for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter: but Ignorance and Stupidity, is the greateſt bleſſing of the Sinners Life; and his moſt admir'd Quality is not to be apprehenſive of Evil, till it cruſh him with its Weight. But if the Sinner be not <hi>fool</hi> enough to arrive at this degree of <hi>brutality,</hi> then as ſoon as the report of the moſt diſtant Evil, or the moſt inconſiderable, reaches his Ear, <hi>how</hi> it fills his Imagination, how it ſhakes his Heart, and how it embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters his Pleaſures? And to what poor and deſpicable Arts, to what baſe and diſhonourable ſhifts does his <hi>Fear</hi> force him? When on the ſame occaſion we diſcover nothing in the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man, but a beautiful mixture of Humility and Faith, Devotion and Confidence, or Aſſurance in God, <hi>He is not afraid of evil tidings; his Heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 112. a frame of Spirit, which to thoſe who have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and ſenſe to obſerve it, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him both more <hi>belov'd</hi> and <hi>rever'd. Lastly,</hi> if we conſider the <hi>wicked</hi> and the <hi>good</hi> Man, actually under the weight and preſſure of <hi>Evil,</hi> how much <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:29455:50"/>
is the ſtate of the <hi>one</hi> in reality to <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>other,</hi> even while the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> circumſtances are the ſame? What Chearfulneſs, what Courage, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, what Hopes adorn the <hi>One!</hi> What Inſtruction to all, what Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Friends and Relations does his Deportment afford! And how does it inſpire and warm the Breaſts of thoſe that converſe with him, with an eſteem for, and love of <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>himſelf!</hi> What Charm, what Delight is there in thoſe gracious Speeches, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed at this time out of a Good Man's Mouth! <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth: The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away, and bleſſed be the Name of the Lord: Thou of very faithfulneſs has cauſed me to be afflicted: God is the strength of my Heart and my Portion for ever:</hi> And ſuch-like. And how often does he pour out his Heart in ſecret before God? How often does he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the gracious and wiſe ends of Divine Chaſtiſement! And how often does he with deſire and thirſt, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on that fulneſs of Joy which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects him in the Preſence of God!

Or it may be, his Inſolence is turned into Crouching and Fawning; his Rudeneſs and Violence, into Artifice and Cunning; and his Irreligion into Superſtition.

               <p>It is commonly ſaid, that <hi>Vertue</hi> is its <hi>own</hi> reward: and though it muſt be acknowledg'd, this is a <hi>reward</hi> which is not ſufficient in <hi>all</hi> Caſes, nor great enough to vanquiſh <hi>ſome</hi> ſorts of <hi>Temptations,</hi> yet there is a great deal of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Weight</hi> in this ſaying.

And when it is once poliſh'd and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, how agreeable are they all to invent and find out, to illuſtrate and adorn, to prove and demonſtrate, to weigh, diſcriminate and diſtinguiſh, to deliberate calmly and impartially, to act with an abſolute Liberty, to deſpiſe little things, and look boldly on dangers; to do all things dextrouſly, to converſe with a <hi>ſweet</hi> and yet a <hi>manly</hi> Air, in <hi>honeſt</hi>

and <hi>open,</hi> yet <hi>taking, obliging</hi> Language! How delightful are theſe things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves! How much do they conduce to the ſervice, the beauty and dignity of Human Life! To theſe <hi>accompliſhed</hi> Minds we owe Hiſtories, Sciences, Arts, Trades, Laws. From all which, if <hi>others</hi> reap an unſpeakable <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> how much more the <hi>Authors,</hi> the <hi>Parents</hi> of them? And all this puts me in Mind of <hi>one</hi> great <hi>Advantage</hi> which the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man enjoys above the moſt <hi>Fortunate</hi> Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſt; which is, that he can never want an <hi>Opportunity</hi> to imploy all the <hi>Vigour</hi> of his Mind, <hi>uſefully</hi> and <hi>delightfully.</hi> Whence it is that <hi>Retirement,</hi> which is the <hi>Priſon</hi> and the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of the <hi>Fool,</hi> is the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of the <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us come at length to <hi>that</hi> Pleaſure which depends upon <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Objects; where, if any where, the <hi>Fool</hi> and <hi>Sinner,</hi> muſt diſpute his Title to <hi>Pleaſure</hi> with the <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Good.</hi> How many things are there here which force us to give the Preference to the <hi>Wiſe</hi> Man?

                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:29455:54"/>
that a <hi>wiſe</hi> Man need not at any time purchaſe his <hi>Pleaſure</hi> at too <hi>dear</hi> a rate; he need not lie, nor cheat, nor crouch, nor fawn: <hi>This</hi> is the price of <hi>ſinful</hi> Pleaſure.

a <hi>Land flood</hi> Impetuous, Muddy, and Irregular: And as ſoon as it <hi>forſakes</hi> the Ground it over-flow'd, it leaves nothing behind it, but <hi>ſlime</hi> and <hi>filth.</hi> Laſtly, the <hi>Wiſe</hi> Man, forming a true <hi>Eſtimate</hi> of the Objects of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and not looking upon them as his <hi>

               <p>All the claim the <hi>Sinner</hi> lays to <hi>Pleaſure</hi> is confin'd to the <hi>Preſent</hi> Moment, which is extreamly <hi>ſhort</hi> and extreamly <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,</hi> the <hi>Time</hi> that is <hi>Past</hi> and to <hi>Come</hi> he <hi>quits</hi> all Pretention to, or <hi>ought</hi> to do ſo.

the <hi>Good Man</hi> of his <hi>Weakneſſes</hi> and <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;</hi> the <hi>one</hi> when he looks back is encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Folly, Wickedneſs</hi> and <hi>Shame,</hi> the other with <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Good Works; Guilt</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> haunt the Reflections of the <hi>one, Peace</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> attend thoſe of the <hi>other.</hi> As to the <hi>time to come,</hi> the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> hath <hi>no</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect at all <hi>beyond</hi> the <hi>Grave,</hi> the <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Chriſtian a very <hi>diſmal</hi> one, the <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>Imperfect</hi> a <hi>doubtful</hi> one; only the <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Perfect</hi> an aſſured, <hi>joyful,</hi> and <hi>delightful</hi> one.

               </p>
               <p>Need I prove, that <hi>Aſſurance</hi> is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable <hi>Pleaſure?</hi> One would think that to Man who is daily engag'd in a <hi>Conflict</hi> with ſome <hi>Evil</hi> or other, it were ſuperfluous to prove that it is a mighty <hi>Pleaſure</hi> to be rais'd, though <hi>not</hi> above the <hi>Aſſault,</hi> though <hi>not</hi> above the <hi>Reach,</hi> yet above the <hi>Venom</hi> and <hi>Malignity</hi> of <hi>Evils:</hi> To be <hi>fill'd</hi> with Joy, and Strength, and Confidence; to

ride <hi>triumphant</hi> under the Protection of the <hi>Divine</hi> Favour, and ſee the Sea of Life, ſwell and toſs it ſelf in vain, <hi>in vain threaten</hi> the Bark it <hi>cannot ſink, in vain invade</hi> the Cable it <hi>cannot burſt.</hi> One would think, that to Man, who lives all his Life long in <hi>Bondage</hi> for fear of <hi>Death,</hi> it ſhould be a ſurprizing <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> to ſee <hi>Death</hi> lie <hi>gaſping</hi> at his Feet, Naked and Impotent without <hi>Sting,</hi> without <hi>Terror:</hi> One would finally think, that to Man, who lives rather by <hi>Hope</hi> then <hi>Enjoyment,</hi> it ſhould not be neceſſary to prove, that the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's Hope,</hi> whoſe Confidence is greater, its Objects more glorious, and its Succeſs more certain than <hi>that</hi> of any worldly Fancy or Project, is full of <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> and that it is a <hi>delightful</hi> Proſpect to ſee the <hi>Heavens</hi> opened, and <hi>Jeſus,</hi> our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> our <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſitting at the <hi>Right</hi> Hand of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have, I think, ſufficiently made out the Subſerviency of <hi>Perfection</hi> to the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of this <hi>preſent</hi> Life, which was the thing propos'd to be done in this <hi>Chapter.</hi> Nor can I imagine what <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> can be ſprung to invalidate what I have ſaid; unleſs there be any thing of Colour in theſe <hi>two.</hi>

               <p>But 2ly, It may be Objected, 'tis true all theſe things ſeem to hang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether well enough in <hi>Speculation,</hi> but when we come to examine the matter of <hi>fact,</hi> we are almoſt tempted to think, that all which you have ſaid to prove

               <p>I Have in the <hi>firſt, ſecond,</hi> and <hi>third</hi> Chapters explain'd the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Religious Perfection.</hi> In the <hi>fourth</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I have inſiſted on <hi>two effects</hi> of it, <hi>Aſſurance</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure:</hi> My method therefore now leads me to the <hi>Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Perfection.</hi> Here I will do <hi>too</hi> things. 1ſt. I will trace out the ſeveral <hi>Steps</hi> and <hi>Advances</hi> of the Chriſtian towards it, and draw up as it were, a ſhort Hiſtory of his Spiritual <hi>Progreſs,</hi> from the very Infancy of Vertue to its Maturity and Manhood. 2ly, I will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe briefly of the <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Perfection.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Chriſtian's</hi> Progreſs <hi>towards</hi> Perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:29455:57"/>Many are the Figures and Metaphors by which the Scripture deſcribes this; alluding <hi>one</hi> while to the Formation, Nouriſhment, and Growth of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man; <hi>another</hi> while to that of Plants and Vegetables: <hi>One</hi> while to the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and increaſing Light, that ſhines more and more to the perfect Day. <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> while to that ſucceſſion of Labours and Expectations, which the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man runs through from Plowing to the Harveſt. But of all the Similes which the Spirit makes uſe of to this end, there is <hi>one</hi> eſpecially that ſeems to me to give us the trueſt, and the livelieſt Image of the Change of a Sinner into a Saint. The Scripture repreſents <hi>Sin</hi> as a ſtate of <hi>Bondage,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> as a ſtate of <hi>Liberty;</hi> and teaches us, that by the ſame ſteps by which an enſlaved and oppreſſed People arrive at their Secular, by the very ſame does the Chriſtian, at his Spiritual Liberty and Happineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then, as ſoon as any Judgment or Mercy, or any other ſort of Call, awakens and penetrates the Sinner, as ſoon as a clear Light breaks in upon him, and makes him ſee and conſider his own ſtate, he is preſently agitated by vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:29455:58"/>
Paſſions according to his different Guilt and Temper, or the different Calls and Motives by which he is wrought upon: One while Fear, another while Shame; one while Indignation, another while Hope, fills his Soul: He reſents the Tyranny, and complains of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of his Luſts; he upbraids him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his folly, and diſcovers a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſhamefulneſs in his Vices, which he did not reflect on ſufficiently before; he is vex'd and troubled at the plagues and miſchiefs his Sin and Folly have already procured him, and thinks he has reaſon to fear, if he perſiſt, others far more intolerable. <hi>Then</hi> he calls to mind the Goodneſs, the long-ſuffering of <hi>God,</hi> the love of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit and of Power;</hi> and how diſtant ſoever he be from Vertue, he diſcerns there is a Beauty and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in it; and cannot but judge the Righteous happy. <hi>Theſe</hi> thoughts, theſe Travels of the mind, if they be not ſtrangled in the Birth by a Man's own wilfulneſs or Puſillanimity, or unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diverted upon ſome Temptations, do kindle in the Boſom of the Sinner, the deſires of Righteouſneſs and <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:29455:58"/>
they fill him with Regret and Shame, caſt him down, and humble him before God, and make him finally reſolve on ſhaking off the Yoke. This may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a ſtate of <hi>Illumination;</hi> and is a ſtate of <hi>Preparation</hi> for, or <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> to <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi> Or if it be <hi>Repentance</hi> it ſelf, 'tis yet but an <hi>Embrio:</hi> To <hi>perfect</hi> it, 'tis neceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Sinner make good his Reſolutions, and actually break with his Luſts; he muſt reject their Sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and boldly oppoſe their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he muſt take part with Reaſon and Religion, keep a Watch and Guard over his Soul, and muſt earneſtly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by Mortification and Diſcipline, by Meditation and Prayer to root out Vice, and Plant Vertue in his Soul. This in the Language of the Prophet is <hi>ceaſing to do Evil, and learning to do well,</hi> Iſa. 1.16, 17. He that has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded thus far, though he feel a great Conflict within, though the Oppoſition of Luſt be very ſtrong, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the diſcharge of his Duty very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, he is nevertheleſs in a ſtate of <hi>Grace;</hi> but in a ſtate of <hi>Childhood</hi> too; he is <hi>ſincere,</hi> but far from being <hi>Perfect.</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:29455:59"/>
And yet <hi>this</hi> is the ſtate which many continue in, to the end of their Lives, being partly abus'd by falſe Notions, and taught to believe from <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. that there is no higher or perfecter ſtate; partly intangled and incumbred by ſome unhappy circumſtances of Life: Or it may be, the Force or <hi>Impetus</hi> of the Soul, towards <hi>Perfection,</hi> is much abated by the Satisfaction of Proſperity, and the many Diverſions and Engagements of a Fortunate Life: But he that will be <hi>Perfect</hi> muſt look upon this ſtate as the beginning of Vertue. For it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that a ſtubborn and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Enemy will not be ſubdued and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally brought under in a Moment. The Chriſtian therefore muſt proſecute this War till he has finiſhed it; I will not ſay by Extirpating, but diſabling the Enemy. But here I would have it well obſerv'd, that the Reducing the Enemy to a low condition, is not always effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an uninterrupted Series of <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> for ſeldom is any ſo Fortunate, or ſo Brave, ſo Wiſe, or ſo watchful, as to meet with no Check in the long Courſe of a difficult War; 'tis enough if he be not diſcourag'd, but inſtructed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29455:59"/>
and awaken'd by it. And to prevent any fatal diſaſter, too Errors muſt careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be avoided. <hi>Firſt,</hi> a haſty and fond confidence in our ſelves, with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weaning contempt and neglect of the Enemy: And <hi>next,</hi> all falſe and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly Projects of Truces and Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations: Nor is the ſitting down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with poor and low Attainments very far removed from this Latter. <hi>This</hi> is the <hi>ſecond</hi> Stage of the Chriſtian's Advance towards <hi>Perfection;</hi> and may be call'd the ſtate of <hi>Liberty.</hi> The <hi>third</hi> and laſt, which now follows, is the ſtate of <hi>Zeal,</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> or as <hi>Myſtick</hi> Wrighters delight to call it the ſtate of <hi>

               <p>The Yoke of ſin being once ſhaken off, the Love of Righteouſneſs, and a delight in it, is more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed: And <hi>now</hi> the Man proceeds to the <hi>laſt</hi> round in the Scale of <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> The Wiſdom, Courage, and Vigour of a Convert, is generally at firſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſubduing his corruptions, in Conquering his ill Habits, and Defeating his Enemies, in watching over his own Heart, and guarding himſelf againſt Temptations. But this being once done,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:29455:60"/>
he is in full <hi>Liberty</hi> to purſue the works of Peace and Love. Now he may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance from <hi>neceſſary</hi> to <hi>voluntary</hi> Acts of Self-denial, which before would have been <hi>putting old Wine into new Bottles,</hi> contrary to the Advice of our <hi>Maſter,</hi> Mat. 9.17. Now he may enlarge his Knowledge, and exchange the <hi>Milk of the Word</hi> for <hi>ſtrong Meat,</hi> for the Wiſdom and the Myſteries of it: Now he may extend his watchfulneſs, his care; and whereas they were before wiſely, for the moſt part, confined to his own ſafety, he may now, like our Saviour, <hi>go about doing good,</hi> Act. 10.38. protecting, ſtrengthning, and reſcuing his weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; propagating the Faith, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming the boſoms of Men with the love of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his Truths: Now in a word, he may give himſelf up to a Life of more exalted Contemplation, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Charity, which will be natural and eaſie now, though it were not ſo in the beginning. And this Life is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> with Confidence and Pleaſure: Now the <hi>Yoke of Chriſt is eaſie, and his burden light,</hi> now he <hi>rejoyces with Joy unſpeakable, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:29455:60"/>
Hopes full of Glory,</hi> Now 'tis not ſo much <hi>he that lives, as Chriſt that lives in him,</hi> For <hi>the life which he now leads,</hi> is entirely the product of Faith and Love, and his greateſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is to maintain the Ground which he has got, and to hold faſt the ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs of his Hope unto the end.</p>
               <p>To render this ſhort account of the growth of Vertue, from its very Seed to Maturity, the more <hi>uſeful,</hi> and to free it from ſome <hi>ſcruples,</hi> which it may otherwiſe give occaſion to, I will here add <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Remarks. 1. That the State and Habit of <hi>Perfection,</hi> is a different thing from ſome ſuddain Flights, or Efforts of an Extraordinary <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and ſo is the fixt, and eſtabliſh'd Tranquility of the Mind, from ſome ſuddain Guſts, and ſhort lived fits of ſpiritual Joy. No man attains to the Habits of Vertue and Pleaſure but by degrees; and the natural method and order by which he advances to <hi>either,</hi> is that which I have ſet down. But as to ſome Sallies of the moſt pure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Paſſions, as to ſhort liv'd fits of <hi>Perfection,</hi> as to tranſcient Taſts, ſhort and ſuddain tranſports of ſpiritual Pleaſure,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:29455:61"/>
it is very often otherwiſe. God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, either to allure the frailty of a new Convert, or to Fortifie his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt ſome hazardous Tryal, does raiſe him to an extraordinary height, by more then uſual Communications of his bleſſed Spirit; and raviſhes him by ſome Glances, as it were of the Beatifick Viſion. Raptures of Love, the melting tenderneſs of a pious Sorrow; the Strength of Reſolution and Faith, the Confidence and Exultancy of Aſſurance, do ſometimes accompany ſome ſort of Chriſtians in the beginnings of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or in the ſtate of <hi>Illumination.</hi> Where the Conviction is full, the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation lively, and the Paſſions tender, it is more eaſie to <hi>gain Perfection</hi> then to <hi>preſerve</hi> it. When a Profligate Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the <hi>day of God's Power</hi> is ſnatch'd like a Fire-brand out of the Fire, reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome amazing and ſurprizing Call, like <hi>Iſrael</hi> by Miracles out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> I wonder not, if ſuch a one <hi>loves much,</hi> becauſe <hi>much has been forgiven him;</hi> I wonder not if he be ſwallowed up by the deepeſt and the livelieſt ſenſe of Guilt and Mercy; I wonder not, if ſuch a one endeavour to repair his paſt Crimes
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:29455:61"/>
by <hi>Heroick</hi> Acts, if he make haſt to redeem his loſt time by a zeal and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance hard to be imitated, never to be parllel'd by others. Hence we read of <hi>Judah's Love in the day of her Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,</hi> Jer. 2.2. And of the <hi>firſt love of the Church of Epheſus,</hi> Rev. 2.4. as the moſt Perfect. And in the firſt times of the Goſpel, when Men were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by aſtoniſhing Miracles, when the Preſence and Example of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his <hi>Followers,</hi> when the Perſpicuity and Authority, the Spirit and Power, the Luſtre and Surprize of the <hi>Word</hi> of Life, and Salvation dazled, over-power'd and tranſported the Minds of Men, and made a thorough change in a moment; and when again, no man profeſſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, but he expected by his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Martyrdom to ſeal the truth of his Profeſſion, I wonder not if Vertue ripened faſt under ſuch miraculous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Heaven, or if <hi>Aſſurance</hi> ſprung up in a moment from theſe bright proofs of an unſhaken Integrity. But we, who live in colder Climates, who behold nothing in ſo clear and bright a Light as thoſe happy Souls did, muſt be content to make ſhorter and ſlower
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:29455:62"/>
Steps towards <hi>Perfection,</hi> and ſatisfie our ſelves with a natural, not miraculous Progreſs. And we, whoſe Vertues are ſo generally under-grown, and our Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als no other then common ones, have no reaſon to expect the Joys of a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Aſſurance,</hi> till we go on to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2ly, As <hi>Perfection</hi> is a work of time, ſo is it of great Expence and Coſt too, I mean, 'tis the effect of much Labour and Travel, Self-denial and Watchfulneſs, Reſolution and Conſtancy. Many are the Dangers, which we are to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter through our whole Progreſs towards it. Why elſe are we exhorted, to <hi>learn to do good? To perfect Holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1, 2. <hi>To be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the Spirit of our Minds, from day to day?</hi> Eph. 4.23. <hi>To watch, stand faſt, to quit us like Men, to be strong?</hi> 1 Cor. 16.13. <hi>To take to us the whole Armour of God that we may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the Devil, and when we have done all, to ſtand,</hi> Eph. 6.11.13. <hi>To uſe all diligence to make our calling and election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. and ſuch like? Nay, which is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, theſe and the like Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:29455:62"/>
were addreſs'd to Chriſtians in <hi>thoſe</hi> times, which had manifold advantages above theſe of <hi>ours.</hi> If I ſhould ſay, That the Spirit of God, the Sanctifying Grace of God, was then power'd forth, in more plentiful meaſures then ever after, not only <hi>Scripture,</hi> as I think, but <hi>Reaſon</hi> too, would be on my ſide. The Intereſt of the Church of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it; Sanctity being as neceſſary as Miracles to Convert the Jew and the Gentile. But beſides this, the then won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, and ſurprizing Light of the Goſpel, the Preſence of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the Fleſh, or of thoſe who had been Eye-witneſſes of his Glory, a crowd of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous Works and Miracles, the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of terrible things, Temporal and Eternal Judgments at the door; and an equal expectation of Glorious ones too: All theſe things breaking in, beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, upon a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> World, over-whelm'd before by thick darkneſs, and whoſe abominations were too notorious to be conceal'd, and too deteſtable to be excuſed or defended, could not but produce a very great and ſudden change. Now therefore, if in theſe times, many did ſtart forth in a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:29455:63"/>
moment fit for <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> if many amongſt theſe were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly changed, juſtified and crowned, I wonder not; <hi>this</hi> was a <hi>day of Power, a day of Glory</hi> wherein God aſſerted Himſelf, exalted his Son, and reſcued the World, by a <hi>ſtretched out Hand.</hi> I ſhould not therefore from hence be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to expect any thing like at <hi>this day.</hi> But yet if notwitſtanding all this, Chriſtians in thoſe happy times, amidſt ſo many Advantages, ſtood in <hi>need</hi> of ſuch Exhortations, what do not we in theſe Times? If ſo much Watchfulneſs, Prayer, Patience, Fear, Abſtinence, and earneſt Contention became them, when God as it were <hi>bowed the Heavens and came down,</hi> and <hi>dwelt amongſt Men,</hi> what becomes us in thoſe days, in the dregs of time, when God ſtands as it were aloof off, to ſee what will be our lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end, retired behind a Cloud, which our Hereſies and Infidelities, Schiſms and Diviſions, Sins and Provocations, have raiſed? To conclude, he that will be <hi>Perfect</hi> muſt not ſit like the Lame Man by <hi>Betheſdah's</hi> Pool, expecting till ſome <hi>Angel</hi> come to cure him; but like our <hi>Lord,</hi> he muſt climb the Mount,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:29455:63"/>
and Pray; and then he may be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, he may be raiſed as much above the Moral Corruption of his Nature by <hi>Perfection,</hi> as our Saviour was, above the Meanneſs and Humility of his Body, by his Glorious <hi>Transfiguration.</hi> Theſe <hi>two</hi> Obſervations are of manifold uſe. For <hi>many</hi> expect Pleaſure when they have no right to it; they would reap, before Vertue be grown up and ripen'd; and being more intent upon the Fruit of Duty, then the diſcharge of it, they are frequently diſappointed and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged. <hi>Others</hi> there are, who miſtaking ſome fits and flaſhes of Spiritual Joy for the Habitual Peace and Pleaſure of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> do entertain too early Confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and inſtead of <hi>perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> they decline, or it may be, fall away through Negligence and Security; or which is as bad, the Duties of Religion grow taſteleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid to them for want of that Pleaſure which they ignorantly or preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly expect ſhould conſtantly attend 'em: And ſo they are diſheartened or diſguſted, and give back; which they would never do, if they did rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that <hi>Perfection</hi> is a work of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:29455:64"/>
time, that a ſetled Tranquility, an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Joy of Spirit, is the Fruit only of <hi>Perfection,</hi> and that thoſe ſhort Gleams of Joy, which break in upon new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, and ſometimes on other imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Chriſtians, do depend upon extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Circumſtances, or are peculiar Favours of Heaven. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> there are <hi>many,</hi> who have entertain'd very odd Fancies about the <hi>Attainment</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;</hi> they talk and act as if <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> were the Product, not of Time and Experience, but an Inſtant; as if it were to be infuſed in a moment not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd; as if it were a meer Arbitrary Favour, not the Fruit of Meditation and Diſcipline? 'Tis true, it cannot be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Chriſtian, but that <hi>Perfection</hi> derives it ſelf from Heaven; and that the Seed of it, is the Grace of God: Yet it is true too, and can as little be doubted by any one who conſults the Goſpel, and the Experience of the beſt Men, that we muſt watch, and pray, and contend, labour, and perſevere, and that long too, e're we can attain it. And whoever fancies himſelf, rapt up into the <hi>third Heaven</hi> on a ſudden, will find himſelf as ſuddenly led down to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:29455:64"/>
the <hi>Earth</hi> again; if he do not uſe his utmoſt diligence to fortifie his Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to cheriſh the New-born Flame, and to guard and improve his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, It may be <hi>Objected</hi> againſt the account I have given of the <hi>growth</hi> of Vertue, that when I come to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of it, my Colours are <hi>too</hi> bright, my Strokes <hi>too</hi> bold, and the Form I have given it <hi>too</hi> Divine. For you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it, will one ſay, as if Man, now grown <hi>Perfect,</hi> had nothing to do, but to enjoy God, and himſelf; as if he were already <hi>entered into Reſt,</hi> and did actually <hi>ſit down with Christ in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places:</hi> as if in a word, <hi>Vertue</hi> were no longer his task, but <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> as if he had nothing to do, but to rejoyce continually, nothing further to preſs after, nothing to combate, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to contend with: Whereas the <hi>Fathers</hi> generally, and all Judicious <hi>Modern</hi> Writers ſeem to place <hi>Perfection</hi> in nothing higher, then in a perpetual Progreſs towards it; they look upon Life as a perpetual warfare, and utterly deny any ſuch Height or Eminence as is rais'd above Clouds and Storms, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:29455:65"/>
Troubles and Temptations. But to <hi>this,</hi> I have <hi>ſeveral</hi> things to ſay, which will <hi>clear</hi> my ſenſe about this Matter, and diſpel all <hi>Objections. Firſt,</hi> I have deſcribed the laſt Stage of the Chriſtian's ſpiritual Progreſs, which I call a ſtate of Zeal, and in which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Chriſtian to commence Perfect; this I ſay, I have deſcribed in the ſame manner, and, as near as I could in the ſame words, which the <hi>Scripture</hi> does. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I do not pretend any where to aſſert, that there is any ſtate in this Life, rais'd above Tryals and Temptations. Alas! The moſt <hi>Perfect</hi> Man, will find it work enough, to make good the Ground he has gain'd, and maintain the Conqueſt he has won; much watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and labour, much humility and fear, and many other Vertues are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Perſeverance in a ſtate of <hi>Perfection. Thirdly,</hi> As the World goes now, and indeed ever did, <hi>Perfection</hi> is a ſtate we arrive at very <hi>late;</hi> and all the way to it, full of Labour and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, full of Dangers and Difficulties; ſo that upon this account, the Life of Man may well enough be ſaid to be a perpetual Warfare. But <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I do
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:29455:65"/>
by no means affirm, that the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man is incapable of Growth and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. Of this I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to unfold my ſenſe more fully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. In the mean time I cannot forbear obſerving here, that there is a great difference between the growth of an <hi>Imperfect</hi> and a <hi>Perfect</hi> Chriſtian; for ſuppoſing Grace to be always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, and the very Maturity of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to admit of Degrees, yet the marks and diſtinctions of ſuch different Degrees are ſo nice and delicate, that the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances</hi> of the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man are ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceptible to himſelf, without the cloſeſt and ſtricteſt Enquiry: Much leſs can they fall under the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others. The <hi>firſt Change</hi> of a Sinner from Darkneſs to Light, from Vice to Virtue, from an averſion for God and Goodneſs to a <hi>Sincere,</hi> though not a <hi>Perfect</hi> Love of both, is very palpable: <hi>So again,</hi> the change from a ſtate of weakneſs and inconſtancy, to one of ſtrength; of conflict and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to one of eaſe and liberty; of fear and doubt, to one of confidence and pleaſure, is little leſs evident and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>But</hi> the ſeveral degrees of growth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:29455:66"/>
                  <hi>afterwards,</hi> the improvements, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, of a Mature ſtate, are of <hi>another</hi> Nature, not conſiſting in a <hi>Change,</hi> but <hi>Adition;</hi> and that made <hi>inſenſibly.</hi> Here therefore, the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man, in order to maintain the Peace and Pleaſure of his Mind, need not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Nice and Scrupulous Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Degrees and Meaſures of his Virtues; 'tis ſufficient that he make good his Poſt, 'tis enough if he follow the advice of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.58. <hi>If he be ſteadfaſt and unmoveable, and always abounding in the Works of the Lord.</hi>

For the Vertues of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:29455:66"/>
Goſpel do all afford mutual ſupport and nouriſhment to one another; and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually Miniſter to their own growth and ſtrength. And <hi>Prayer</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper,</hi> not to mention <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Pſalmody, Converſation, Diſcipline,</hi> are founded upon the belief of all the Myſteries of our Religion; and conſiſt in the Exerciſe of almoſt all Chriſtian Graces, as Repentance, Faith, Hope, Charity: But this would be an endleſs task. I purpoſe therefore, here only to lay down ſome few <hi>General Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which may ſerve for directions in the uſe of <hi>Goſpel Means,</hi> point out the <hi>End</hi> we are to aim at, and enable us to reap the utmoſt <hi>Benefit</hi> from them. Theſe <hi>Obſervations</hi> are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Practice</hi> of Wiſdom and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is the beſt way to improve and ſtrengthen both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Two</hi> general and immediate <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,</hi> as of <hi>Converſion,</hi> ſo of <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> too, are the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The natural and immediate <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>Meditation, Prayer, Euchariſt, Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mody,</hi> and good <hi>Converſation,</hi> is, the quickning and enlivening the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> the Fortifying and Confirming our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:29455:67"/>
and the raiſing and keeping up an <hi>Heavenly Frame</hi> of Spirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The immediate <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> are the ſubduing the <hi>Pride</hi> of the Heart, and reducing the <hi>Appetites</hi> of the Body.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Laſtly, Some</hi> kinds of Life are better ſuited and accommodated to the great <hi>Ends</hi> of Religion and Vertue, than <hi>others.</hi> I will very <hi>briefly</hi> Illuſtrate <hi>each</hi> of theſe <hi>Obſervations,</hi> and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt from them ſuch <hi>Rules,</hi> as I ſhall judge moſt ſerviceable to promote <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. The <hi>Practice</hi> of Wiſdom and Vertue, is the beſt way to improve and ſtrengthen both. This is a Propoſition almoſt Self-evident: For beſides that, it is acknowldg'd on all Hands, that the frequent repetition of ſingle <hi>Acts</hi> of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is the natural way to arrive at an <hi>Habit</hi> of it; the <hi>Practice</hi> of Vertue gives a Man great boldneſs towards God, mingles Joy and Pleaſure in all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to him, purifies and enlightens the Mind; and entitles him to more plentiful Meaſures of Grace, and higher degrees of Favour. <hi>If ye continue in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:29455:67"/>
my Word, then are ye my Diſciples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and ye ſhall know the Truth, and the Truth ſhall make you free,</hi> Joh. 8.31.3, <hi>To him that hath, ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance,</hi> Mat. 13.12. If this be ſo, as undoubtedly it is, it is plain, That we ought not to be fond of ſuch a Solitude or Retirement, as cuts off the opportunity of many Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which may be daily practis'd in a more publick and active Life. The true <hi>Anchorite</hi> or <hi>Hermite,</hi> was at <hi>firſt,</hi> little <hi>better</hi> then a <hi>Pious Extravagant:</hi> I will not ſay how much <hi>worſe</hi> he is <hi>now.</hi> Meditation and Prayer are excellent Duties, but Meekneſs and Charity, Mercy and Zeal are not one jot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to them. The <hi>World</hi> is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>School</hi> to a good Chriſtian; the Follies and the Miſeries, the Tryals and Temptations of it, do not only exerciſe and employ our Vertue, but cultivate and improve it: They afford us both <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Advance us on towards a ſolid Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and a well-ſetled Power over our ſelves. 'Tis our own fault if every Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident that befalls us, and every one whom we converſe with, do not teach
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:29455:68"/>
us ſomewhat; occaſion ſome wiſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection;</hi> or enkindle ſome Pious <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> in us. We do not reflect on our Words and Actions, we do not obſerve the motions of our own Hearts as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently as we ought; we make little or no Application of what we ſee or hear, nor learn any thing from the Wiſdom, and the Vertue, the Folly and the Madneſs of <hi>Man,</hi> and the conſequences of both: And ſo, we neither improve our <hi>Knowledge,</hi> nor our <hi>Vertue,</hi> but are the ſame to <hi>day</hi> we were <hi>yesterday,</hi> and Life <hi>waſtes</hi> away in common Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and cuſtomary Actions, with as little alteration in us, as in our Affairs: Whereas, were we mindful, as we ought of our true Intereſt, and deſirous to reap ſome ſpiritual Benefit from every thing, the Vertues of <hi>Good</hi> Men would enkindle our Emulation, and the Folly and Madneſs of <hi>Sinners</hi> would confirm our abhorrence for Sin; from <hi>one</hi> we ſhould learn Content, from <hi>another</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, here we ſhould ſee a Charm in Meekneſs and Charity, <hi>there</hi> in Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; in <hi>this</hi> Man we ſhould ſee Reaſon to admire Diſcretion, and Command of himſelf, in <hi>that</hi> Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,

Aſſiduity and Perſeverance: Nor would it be leſs uſeful to us, to obſerve, how Vanity expoſes <hi>one,</hi> and Peeviſhneſs torments <hi>another;</hi> how Pride and Ambition embroil a <hi>third,</hi> and how hateful and contemptible Avarice renders a <hi>fourth;</hi> and to trace all that variety of ruin, which Luſt, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, Diſorder, and Sloth leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them.</p>
               <p>And as this kind of Obſervations will fill us with ſolid and uſeful <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> ſo will a diligent attention to the Rules of Righteouſneſs, and diſcretion in all the common and daily actions of Life, enrich us with true <hi>Vertue, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> is not to be confin'd to the <hi>Church,</hi> and to the <hi>Cloſet,</hi> nor to be exerciſed only in <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Sacraments, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation</hi> and <hi>Alms;</hi> but every where, we are in the Preſence of God, and every Word, every Action, is capable of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</hi> Our Defects and Infirmities, betray themſelves in the daily Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and the common Converſation of Life; and <hi>here</hi> they draw after them very important Conſequences; and therefore <hi>here</hi> they are to be watched over, regulated and govern'd, as well

as in our more <hi>ſolemn</hi> Actions.

Let no Man then, that will be <hi>Perfect</hi> or <hi>Happy,</hi> abandon himſelf to his Humours or Inclinations in his Carriage towards his Acquaintance, his Children, his Servants: Let no Man, that will be <hi>Perfect</hi> or <hi>Happy,</hi> follow <hi>Prejudice</hi> or <hi>Faſhion</hi> in the common and cuſtomary Actions of Life: But let him aſſure himſelf, that by a daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to conform theſe more and more to the excellent Rules of the Goſpel, he is to train up himſelf by degrees to the moſt abſolute <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and the moſt <hi>Perfect Vertue,</hi> he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of.

thoſe things, which, for want of due Reflection, do not commonly ſeem of any great Importance.

               <p n="2">§. 2. The <hi>two</hi> great <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> not of <hi>Regeneration</hi> only, but alſo of <hi>Perſeverance</hi> and <hi>Perfection,</hi> are the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> This no Man <hi>doubts,</hi> that is a Chriſtian: And therefore I will not go about to <hi>prove</hi> it: Nor will I at preſent diſcourſe of the Energy and Operation of the <hi>one,</hi> and the <hi>other;</hi> or examine what each is in its ſelf, or wherein the one differs from the other. 'Tis abundantly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if we be aſſured, that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> are proper and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:29455:70"/>
                  <hi>Means</hi> to attain the great <hi>Ends,</hi> I have mentioned, namely, our <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> and <hi>Perfection.</hi> And that they are ſo, is very plain from thoſe <hi>Texts,</hi> which do expreſly aſſert, That the <hi>Goſpel</hi> contains all thoſe Truths, that are neceſſary, to the clear Expoſition of our Duty, or to the moving and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging us to the Practice of it. And that the <hi>Spirit</hi> implies a ſupply of all that ſupernatural ſtrength, be it what it will, that is neceſſary to enable us, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to will, but to do, that which the Goſpel convinces us to be our Duty. <hi>Such</hi> are, Rom. 8.2. <hi>For the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16, 17. <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs.

We cannot have too great a Value, too great a Paſſion for the <hi>Book of God;</hi> nor fix our Thoughts and Hearts too earneſtly upon the truths of it. We muſt imitate the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> in behalf of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> thanks God, <hi>becauſe when they received the Word of God which they heard of him, they received it not as the Word of Men, but as it is in Truth, the Word of God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.13. that is, we muſt entertain the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as <hi>that,</hi> which has Infallible Truth in all
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:29455:71"/>
its Doctrines, uncontroulable Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all its Precepts, a Divine Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all its Promiſes and Threats, and a Divine Wiſdom in all its Counſels and Directions: And <hi>he</hi> that thus believes, will certainly find the Goſpel to work effectually in <hi>him,</hi> as it did in the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> What Light and Beauty will he diſcern in all its Deſcriptions of our Duty! What force in all its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions! what Majeſty, what Dignity, what Life, what Power, what Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what Support! In one word, what Heavenly Vertue will he diſcern in each part of it, and what vaſt and unfathomable Wiſdom in the whole Compoſure and Contrivance of it! How will he then admire it, how will he love it, how will he ſtudy it, how will he delight in it! How will he be tranſported by the Promiſes, and awed by the Threats of it! How will he be pierced and ſtruck through by thoſe Exaggerations of Sin, and Captiv'd and Enamour'd by thoſe lively and Divine Deſcriptions of Vertue he meets in it! How will he adore the Goodneſs of <hi>God,</hi> conſpicuous in our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! How will he be inflam'd with the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:29455:71"/>
love of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and be amaz'd at his Condeſcenſion and Humility! <hi>This</hi> and much more is the natural effect of our receiving the <hi>Goſpel</hi> as we ought, and pondering the truths of it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and inceſſant Meditation. This the Royal <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> was abundantly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, <hi>Thy word have I hid in my Heart; that I might not ſin againſt thee,</hi> Pſal. 119.11. <hi>Thou through thy Commandments has made me wiſer then mine Enemies: for they are ever with me. I have more underſtanding then all my teachers: for thy Teſtimonies are my Meditation,</hi> ver. 98. To which I might add many other <hi>verſes</hi> out of that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> containing the various and mighty <hi>Effects</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Nor will any one think, that I attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute too much to the ſtudy of this <hi>Word of Life,</hi> who ſhall conſider that it is one of the great Works of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> to <hi>incline our Hearts to the Teſtimonies of God, to write his Laws in our Hearts,</hi> to diſpoſe us to attend to revealed Truths; and in one word, to fix our Minds and Thoughts upon them. 2. Since the <hi>Spirit</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is a joynt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:29455:72"/>
of <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Perfection,</hi> 'tis manifeſt, That we ought to live in a continual dependance upon God. <hi>He</hi> muſt be our Hope and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the <hi>Day of Tryal: He</hi> muſt be our Praiſe and Boaſt in the <hi>Day of Victory,</hi> and in the <hi>Day of Peace:</hi> when we <hi>lie down,</hi> and when we <hi>riſe up,</hi> we muſt ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, 'tis thou Lord that makeſt me dwell in ſafety,</hi> Pſal. 1.4. We muſt look upon our ſelves as ſurrounded by Enemies, and beſieged by <hi>Spiritual</hi> Dangers, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was by <hi>Temporal:</hi> And as <hi>he</hi> in the one, ſo muſt we in the <hi>other,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Strength and Salvation from <hi>Him. Through God we ſhall do valiantly; for he it is that ſhall tread down our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> Pſal. 60.12. <hi>Many Nations compaſs me round about; but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them.</hi> And when we have conquer'd Temptations, and routed the Powers of Darkneſs, we muſt aſcribe all, not to our own ſtrength, nor to our own watchfulneſs, but to the Grace and the Power of God. <hi>If the Lord himſelf had not been on our ſide: Now may</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſay, if the Lord himſelf had not been on our ſide,</hi> when
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:29455:72"/>
the Legions of Hell combined with the World and Fleſh againſt us, <hi>they had ſwallowed us up alive,</hi> Pſal. 124.1, 2, 3. Now <hi>many</hi> will be the happy <hi>effects</hi> of this dependance upon God: we ſhall be paſſionately deſirous of his Preſence, of his Grace and Favour; we ſhall dreſs and prepare our Souls, we ſhall awaken and diſpoſe all our Faculties to receive him; we ſhall ever do the things that may invite and prevail with him to abide with us; we ſhall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of his forſaking <hi>us,</hi> as the greateſt Evil that can befall us. <hi>Lift up your Heads, O ye Gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlaſting Doors; and the King of Glory ſhall come in,</hi> awake O my Soul, raiſe thy ſelf above this World and Fleſh, that thou mayeſt be fit for the <hi>King of Glory</hi> to dwell in thee: <hi>who is the King of Glory? The Lord ſtrong and mighty, the Lord migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Battel;</hi> that Holy Spirit that ſubdues our Enemies, that ſtrengthens us with might, and fills us with Courage and Holy Alacrity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.7, 8. Nor does the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> prepare his Soul for God by Meditation only, and Spiritual Recollection, and Soliloquies, but by a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:29455:73"/>
careful and circumſpect Regulation of all his Actions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.2, 3. <hi>I will behave my ſelf wiſely in a perfect way: O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my Houſe with a perfect Heart. I will ſet no wicked thing before mine Eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aſide, it ſhall not cleave to me.</hi> And how earneſtly does he pray againſt God's forſaking him? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.11. <hi>Cast me not away from thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and take not thy Holy Spirit from me.</hi> The <hi>Reſult</hi> of all this, muſt needs be <hi>Steadfaſtneſs</hi> and <hi>Growth</hi> in Holineſs and Goodneſs. For <hi>first,</hi> This is the natural influence of ſuch a dependance upon God; it places us as always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Him, and makes us walk humbly and circumſpectly as becomes thoſe, that are awed by the Preſence of ſo Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Majeſty: I have <hi>ſet the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before me; becauſe he is at my right-hand, I ſhall not be moved,</hi> Pſal. 16.1. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we cannot doubt but that God will plentifully beſtow his Grace on thoſe, who thus rely upon him. For where can He beſtow it with more Advantage to his Glory, or to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Holineſs; both which are
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:29455:73"/>
ſo dear to him? Who is a Subject more capable of it, or who can be better entitled to it, then he who thus depends upon God? As he begs it <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> and receives it <hi>Thankfully;</hi> ſo he will Husband it <hi>Carefully,</hi> and employ it <hi>Zealouſly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. In <hi>Prayer, Meditation,</hi> and other <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> duties of Religion, we are to aim at <hi>one</hi> or <hi>all</hi> of theſe <hi>three</hi> things. 1. The Quickning and Enlivening the <hi>Conſcience.</hi> 2. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming and Strengthning our <hi>Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of obedience. 3. The Raiſing and Keeping up <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Devout Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Great is the benefit of <hi>each</hi> of theſe: <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> will keep us, not only from Evil, but every appearance of it; increaſe of <hi>Spiritual Strength,</hi> will render us ſteadfaſt and unmoveable in all the Works of God; and <hi>Holy Paſſion</hi> will make us abound in them. To ſpiritual <hi>Paſſion</hi> we owe the Zeal and Pleaſure; to ſpiritual <hi>Strength,</hi> or <hi>Liberty,</hi> the Conſtancy and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, of an Holy Life; and both <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> are generally ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a <hi>Tender</hi> and <hi>Enlighten'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> For while the <hi>Conſcience</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:29455:74"/>
a <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>nice</hi> ſenſe of Good and Evil, all the great Truths of the Goſpel will have their proper Force, and natural Efficacy upon us. Theſe then are the Genuine <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> the <hi>Euchariſt, Pſalmody,</hi> and ſuch-like: If they do not add Life and Light to the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> if they do not augment our <hi>Strength,</hi> nor exalt our <hi>Paſſions,</hi> if they do not increaſe our deteſtation of Sin, and our Love to God and Goodneſs; if they do not quicken and excite Devout Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, if they do not engage and refreſh the Soul by Holy Joy and Heavenly Pleaſure; if, I ſay, they do not in ſome degree or other promote <hi>theſe</hi> things, we reap <hi>no</hi> benefit at all from them, or we can never be <hi>certain</hi> that we do. But though the Ends I have mentioned, be of this great uſe to <hi>all,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>all</hi> are obliged to aim at them, yet may the <hi>different</hi> Defects and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of <hi>different</hi> Chriſtians, render <hi>one</hi> of theſe Ends more neceſſary then <hi>another:</hi> And by conſequence, it will be <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> more immediately and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to intend and purſue <hi>that.</hi> For <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> if a Man's <hi>Temper</hi> be ſuch, that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:29455:74"/>
his <hi>Paſſions</hi> do ſoon kindle, and ſoon die again; that he is apt to Form wiſe and great Projects, and as unapt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh any thing; in <hi>this</hi> Caſe, it will be his Duty to aim eſpecially at the <hi>increaſe of Strength.</hi> But if on the <hi>other</hi> hand, a Man's <hi>Temper be</hi> Cold and Phlegmatick, Slow and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy; it is but fit, that he ſhould parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly apply himſelf to the awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exciting <hi>Devout Affections</hi> in his Soul. For <hi>as</hi> excellent purpoſes do often miſcarry for want of Conſtancy and Firmneſs of Mind: <hi>ſo</hi> Steadineſs and Firmneſs of Mind, doth ſeldom effect any great matter, when it wants Life and Paſſion to put it into Motion. <hi>Again,</hi> if one's <hi>paſt</hi> Life has been very <hi>Sinful,</hi> or the <hi>preſent</hi> be not very <hi>Fruitful,</hi> it will behove ſuch a one to increaſe the <hi>Tenderneſs of Conſcience,</hi> to add more Light and Life to its <hi>Convictions;</hi> that by a daily Repetition of Contrition and Compunction, he may waſh off the <hi>Stain,</hi> or by the Fruitfulneſs of his following Life, repair the <hi>Barrenneſs</hi> of that Paſt. Having thus in few words, both made out the Uſefulneſs of thoſe <hi>three Ends</hi> I propoſed to a Chriſtian in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:29455:75"/>
the performance of <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> duties of Religion, and ſhewed in what Caſes he may be obliged to aim more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately at <hi>one</hi> then <hi>another,</hi> I will <hi>now</hi> enquire, and that as briefly as I can, <hi>how</hi> theſe <hi>three Ends</hi> may be <hi>ſcured</hi> and <hi>promoted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. Of <hi>Tenderneſs of Conſcience,</hi> or the full and lively Convictions of it.</p>
               <p>To promote this, the <hi>firſt</hi> thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary is <hi>Meditation.</hi> No Man, who diligently ſearches and ſtudies the <hi>Book of God,</hi> can be a Stranger, to <hi>himſelf,</hi> or to his <hi>Duty. Not</hi> to his <hi>Duty;</hi> for this <hi>Book</hi> reveals the whole <hi>Will of God</hi> in clear and full Terms, it gives us ſuch Infallible <hi>Characters</hi> of Good and Evil, Right and Wrong, as render our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Error inexcuſable: It points out the great <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> ſo plainly, and conducts us to them by ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and unerring <hi>Rules,</hi> that there is no variety of Circumſtances can ſo perplex and ravel our Duty, but that an <hi>honeſt</hi> Man by the help of this, may eaſily diſcover it. For this Reaſon 'tis, that the <hi>Word of God</hi> is called <hi>Light,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it does diſtinguiſh between Good and Evil, Right and Wrong, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:29455:75"/>
like a <hi>Lamp</hi> does manifeſt the Path which we are to chooſe, and diſperſes that <hi>Miſt</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> with which the Luſt of Man, and the Subtilty of Hell has covered it. And for this Reaſon 'tis, that the Good have ſuch a <hi>Value,</hi> and the Wicked, ſuch an <hi>Averſion</hi> for the <hi>Book of God.</hi> For, <hi>every one that doth Evil hateth the Light, neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Light, leſt his Deeds ſhould be reproved. But he that doth Truth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Light, that his Deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God,</hi> Joh. 3.20, 21. Nor can he that Studies the <hi>Word of God,</hi> be a Stranger to <hi>Himſelf</hi> any more then to his Duty. For this Light ranſacks all the Receſſes of the Soul; it traces all its Affections back to their firſt Springs and Sources; it lays open all its Deſires and Projects, and ſtrips its moſt ſecret Purpoſes of all their Diſguiſe: <hi>For the word of God is quick and powerful, and ſharper then any two Edged Sword; piercing even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts and Marrow; and is a diſcerner of the thoughts, and intents of the Heart,</hi> Heb. 4.12. In a word, if we would preſerve the <hi>Conſcience
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29455:76"/>
quick,</hi> and <hi>ſenſible,</hi> we muſt be daily converſant in the <hi>Book of God.</hi> For this commands with that Authority, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs with that clearneſs, perſwades with that Force, reproves with that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Prudence, and Charity, that we ſhall not eaſily be able to reſiſt it; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes Righteouſneſs and Sin in ſuch true and lively Colours, proclaims Rewards and Puniſhments in ſuch powerful and moving Language, that it rouſes even the Dead in Sin, penetrates and wounds the ſtupid and obdurate.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Meditation</hi> we muſt add <hi>Prayer.</hi> For this is a very proper and eſſential <hi>Means</hi> to refreſh and renew in the Soul, the Hatred of Sin, and Love of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and to improve thoſe Impreſſions which <hi>Meditation</hi> has made upon it. We cannot eaſily put up Petitions to <hi>God</hi> with Confidence, unleſs we do the things that <hi>pleaſe</hi> him; for our Hearts will miſgive us, and our very Petitions will reproach us: And the meer <hi>Thought</hi> of entring more immediately into the Preſence of God, does oblige us to a more careful Tryal and Examination of our Actions. For God being not only Omniſcient but Juſt and Holy too, we
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:29455:76"/>
can no more flatter our ſelves with the Hope of Pardon for any Sin into which we are betrayed by fondneſs or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, then we can imagine him Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it. But this is not all; we are to pray, that God would enable us to <hi>ſearch</hi> out and <hi>diſcover</hi> our own <hi>Hearts,</hi> Pſal. 139.23, 24. <hi>Search me O God, and know my Heart: Try me and know my Thoughts; and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi> And if we do this ſincerely, God will undoubtedly grant our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts; and will lay open to us all our preſent Defects, and Infirmities, and ſhew us how far ſhort we come of the <hi>Glory of God:</hi> that <hi>Perfection</hi> of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Happineſs, which many Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Saints</hi> actually arrived at upon Earth. And we way be ſure, <hi>that</hi> Light which breaks in upon our Mind with this Brightneſs, will not ſuffer any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Corruptions</hi> to continue undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; nor permit us to forget the Stains and Ruins, which the <hi>Sins</hi> of our paſt Life, have left behind them. <hi>Converſation</hi> is another way, by which we learn to know our ſelves, and by which, <hi>Conſcience</hi> is kept <hi>awake,</hi> and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:29455:77"/>
in its <hi>Vigour.</hi> How Convictive, how <hi>moving</hi> is the Diſcourſe of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and Pious <hi>Friend?</hi> When he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, or when he rejoyces, when he relates the Hiſtory of his own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when he lets us ſee the Deſigns he has Form'd, and the excellent Ends his Soul thirſts after, how does our Heart burn within us? What variety of <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> does it <hi>raiſe</hi> in us, when he makes his remarks on Human Nature and the World, when he bewails the diſhonour of God and the decay of Religion amongſt us, when he relates the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and misfortune of Sinners, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the particular Sins and Follies that occaſioned it? How often does he hereby <hi>provoke</hi> us to wiſe <hi>Reflections</hi> on our ſelves? How many new Beauties does he <hi>diſcover</hi> to us in Vertue, how many Deformities in Sin, which had eſcaped <hi>our</hi> Obſervations? But 'tis not the <hi>Converſation</hi> only of my Friend, but his <hi>Life</hi> alſo, from which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, or may do ſo, <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition.</hi> The <hi>Perfections</hi> of my <hi>Friend,</hi> are the gentleſt and the mildeſt, and yet the moſt awakening <hi>Reproofs</hi> too of my <hi>own Defects;</hi> and by the Freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29455:77"/>
and Luſtre of <hi>his Vertue,</hi> I diſcern beſt the Weakneſs and the Dimneſs of my <hi>own.</hi> How often have I been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to turn my Thoughts with ſome <hi>Indignation</hi> on my own Heats and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, while I have admired and bleſt the ſweetneſs and the gentleneſs, the ſoftneſs and the calm, very conſpicuous in an excellent Friend? And when I have heard <hi>another</hi> mention his <hi>Nightly Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and thoſe Divine Thoughts which filled the <hi>Intervals</hi> of his <hi>Sleep,</hi> and made thoſe Hours that are ſo burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to ſome, the moſt entertaining and delightful parts of his Reſt, how have I been inwardly filled with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and Shame? How have I up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided and reproached my ſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the ſluggiſhneſs of my Daies, the dulneſs and the wandrings of my Soul by Night? And I believe every ſincere Man muſt find himſelf thus affected on the like occaſions. For in <hi>this</hi> kind of <hi>Reproof,</hi> which I talk of, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of Force and Authority than is to be found in any <hi>other;</hi> for the Example of Friends, does not only teach us <hi>what</hi> we are to do, but demonſtrates alſo that it <hi>may</hi> be done. Nor does
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29455:78"/>
Vertue any where appear with ſo lovely and charming an <hi>Air</hi> as in a Friend. But after all, amongſt all the benefits we gain by excellent Friendſhips, we ought not to reckon <hi>this</hi> as the <hi>least,</hi> that it is one, and that an indiſpenſable <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> to <hi>admoniſh</hi> and <hi>reprove: For the reproofs of Inſtruction are the Paths of Life,</hi> Prov. 6.23. But then, that we may be capable of this Bleſſing, we muſt diſpoſe our Minds to <hi>expect</hi> and <hi>bear</hi> reproof: We muſt ſtrive after an humble and teachable temper; and we muſt invite and incourage our Friends to this kindeſt Office; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by unaffected requeſts, but alſo by <hi>obeying</hi> their advice, <hi>pardoning</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Infirmity may be interſpers'd with it, and <hi>loving</hi> them the better, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they deſerve: For there is ſcarce any <hi>better</hi> proof of their Affection, Prudence, and Courage, which they are capable of giving us.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. A <hi>Second</hi> End of <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> Duties is the <hi>Increaſe of Spiritual Strength.</hi> Now <hi>Spiritual Strength</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the Power and Dominion we have over our Affections and Actions: and it ſtands upon <hi>two Baſes;</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:29455:78"/>
of Sin,</hi> and the <hi>Growth of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;</hi> whatever does weaken and reduce our propenſions to Sin, whatever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the ſubjection of the Body, adds Power and Authority to the Mind, and renders Vertue more eaſie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. And becauſe Vertues have a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Connexion and Dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another; therefore whatever promotes any one, promotes all. But eſpecially whatever ſtrengthens our Hope, or quickens our Fear, or enlarges our Knowledge, and increaſes our Faith; this does confirm and eſtabliſh our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution more then any thing elſe. <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>Root, Fear</hi> the <hi>Guard,</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> the <hi>Spur</hi> of all our Vertues. Faith convinces us what is our Duty; Fear makes us Impartial, Diligent and Watchful; Hope reſolved, and active in the Proſecution of it. It being thus clear, <hi>what</hi> our <hi>Spiritual Strength</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in, it will be eaſie to diſcern by what <hi>means</hi> we are to gain it. But I can here only ſuggeſt thoſe Hints and Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the <hi>Reader</hi> muſt upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as he needs, inlarge and improve. 1. <hi>Meditation</hi> is the <hi>firſt</hi> thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. We muſt often ſurvey the Grounds
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:29455:79"/>
and Foundations of our Faith; we muſt conſider frequently and ſeriouſly the <hi>Scripture Topicks</hi> of Hope and Fear, ſuch are the Death of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, the Holineſs and Juſtice, and the Omnipreſence of <hi>God:</hi> We muſt diligently obſerve the Wiles and Stratagems of <hi>Satan,</hi> the Arts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations of the <hi>World</hi> and <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and mark the Progreſs of <hi>Sin</hi> from its very beginning to Maturity; and all this with a particular regard to the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our own <hi>Nature,</hi> and the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of our own <hi>Hearts.</hi> We muſt often ponder upon the Beauty and Peace of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> the love of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Vertues, ſufferings, and Crowns of <hi>Martyrs.</hi> And <hi>finally,</hi> if we will increaſe in <hi>ſtrength,</hi> we muſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe this duty of <hi>Meditation</hi> often, and we muſt not ſuffer our ſelves to be withdrawn from it, or be prevail'd with to intermit it on any ſlight and trivial pretences. And becauſe we are not always <hi>Maſters</hi> of our own <hi>Affairs,</hi> nor conſequently of our <hi>Time,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought we to have ever ready at hand, a good Collection of <hi>Texts,</hi> which contain in <hi>few</hi> words, the Power and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29455:79"/>
Spirit of <hi>Goſpel Motives,</hi> the <hi>Perfection</hi> and Beauty of Duties, and the ſubſtance of Advice and Counſel: And to fix theſe ſo in our <hi>Memory,</hi> that they may ſerve as a <hi>Shield</hi> for us to oppoſe, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> did, <hi>againſt the Darts of the Devil,</hi> and as a <hi>ſupply</hi> of excellent and uſeful Thoughts upon a ſuddain, ſo that in all the little Interruptions of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the many little vacancies of the Day, the Mind, which is an active and buſie Spirit, may never want a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>ſubject</hi> to work upon; much leſs looſe it ſelf in wild and laſie amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or <hi>defile</hi> it ſelf by vain or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Thoughts. But we muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take care that <hi>Meditation</hi> be frequent, but alſo that it be not looſe and roving. To which end it will be neceſſary to Study our <hi>ſelves</hi> as well as the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and to be intimately acquainted with the advantages and diſadvantages of our Conſtitution, and our State; that ſo in our <hi>Meditations</hi> on the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> we may more particularly have an Eye on thoſe Vices <hi>we</hi> are moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to, and thoſe Vertues which are either more neceſſary, or more fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and under-grown.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:29455:80"/>Next after <hi>Meditation</hi> muſt follow <hi>Prayer.</hi> Great is the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> in promoting Chriſtian Strength and Fortitude; whether we conſider its <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence upon God,</hi> or its natural <hi>Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon our ſelves.</hi> If we conſider the <hi>latter,</hi> what Divine Force and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy is there in the Confidences of Faith, the Joys of Hope, the earneſt Longings and Deſires of Love, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sorrows of Contrition, the delight of Praiſes and Thankſgivings, the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Self-depreſſions of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Humility, and the Reſolutions and Vows of a perfect Abhorrence of, and Holy Zeal and Indignation againſt Sin! How do theſe things mellow and enrich the Soul? How do they raiſe it higher and higher above <hi>the Corruption which is in the World through Luſt!</hi> How do they renew it daily, and make it a <hi>Partaker of the Divine Nature!</hi> The Repetition of the ſame acts natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally begets an Habit; and Habit is the Strength and Perfection of the Soul; for it is a diſpoſition ripen'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by Cuſtom. How naturally then muſt <hi>Prayer</hi> fortifie the Mind, ripen good Diſpoſitions, or add Strength and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:29455:80"/>
Perfection to good Habits! Since it is nothing elſe, but a repeated <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of almoſt all the Graces of the Goſpel, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Faith, Hope, Charity, and the like: And it ought to be obſerved, that <hi>Prayer</hi> gives us a frequent oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of exerciſing <hi>thoſe</hi> Vertues, which we ſhould not otherwiſe be ſo often oblig'd to do. If <hi>Secondly,</hi> we enquire into the <hi>Prevalence of Prayer with God,</hi> we ſhall have further Reaſons yet to reſolve, that it is a moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual <hi>means</hi> of <hi>increaſing our ſpiritual Strength.</hi> What will God deny to the Prayer of a Righteous Man? He may deny him temporal things, becauſe they are not good for him: He may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to remove a Temptation, becauſe this is often an occaſion of his own Glory and his Servants Reward, but he will never refuſe him Grace to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it. He will no more deny his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to one that earneſtly and ſincerely begs it, than the natural Parent will Bread to his hungry and craving Child. And no wonder, ſince Grace is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the ſpiritual Life as Bread to the natural, the goodneſs of God is more tender and compaſſionate than any
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:29455:81"/>
Inſtinct in Human Nature; and the Purity and Perfection of God more zealouſly ſolicitous for the Holineſs and Immortality of <hi>his</hi> Children then Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Parents can be for a Sickly, periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life of theirs. Thus then 'tis plain, that <hi>Prayer</hi> contributes wonderfully to the <hi>Strengthening</hi> and <hi>Eſtabliſhing</hi> the Mind of Man in Goodneſs. But then we muſt remember, that it muſt have theſe <hi>two Qualifications;</hi> it muſt be <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,</hi> and <hi>inceſſantly Importunate.</hi> 1. It muſt be <hi>Frequent.</hi> I would have this Rule comply'd with as far as it may, even in our ſtated, regular, and ſolemn Addreſſes to God. But becauſe Buſineſs, and ſeveral Obligations we lie under to the World, do often preſs hard upon us, therefore muſt I give the ſame Counſel <hi>here,</hi> which I did before under the <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Meditation,</hi> that is, to have always ready and imprinted in our <hi>Memory</hi> ſeveral <hi>Texts of Scripture,</hi> containing the moſt weighty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Truths, in the moſt piercing and moving Language; that we may be able to form theſe on a ſuddain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ejaculations,</hi> in which, our <hi>Souls</hi> may mount up into <hi>Heaven,</hi> amidſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:29455:81"/>
the Ardours and Tranſports of Deſires and Praiſes, as the Angel did, in the Flame of <hi>Manoah's</hi> Sacrifice. 2. <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> muſt be <hi>inceſſantly Importunate. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate</hi> it will be, if the Soul be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd and diſpos'd as it ought; that is, if it be diſengaged from this World, and poſſeſſed entirely with the Belief and earneſt Expectation of a better; if it be humbled in it ſelf, diſclaim all Strength and Merit of its own, and reſt wholly on the Goodneſs and All-ſufficiency of God. I add <hi>Inceſſantly</hi> in Conformity to the <hi>Parables</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> Luke 11.8. and 18.5. and the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.17. And whoever conſiders Human Nature well, and remembers how ſoon pious Motions vaniſh, and how little they effect, will diſcern a plain Reaſon, both for <hi>Vehemence</hi> and <hi>Perſeverance</hi> in <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi> For <hi>Vehemence,</hi> that the Soul may be deeply impreſſed by pious Paſſions; for <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> that ſuch Impreſſions may not be effaced and obliterated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor let any one fancy, That <hi>Prayer</hi> thus qualified has not a better influence upon <hi>God</hi> as well as upon <hi>our ſelves:</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>God</hi> is void of the painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:29455:82"/>
and defects of <hi>Human</hi> Paſſions, but not of the Perfection of <hi>Divine</hi> ones. Woe were to us, if God were an inflexible, inexorable Deity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being wrought upon by the inceſſant Importunity of his poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Woe were to us, if the ſoftneſs and the tenderneſs of the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature, did not infinitely exceed the little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances of it in <hi>Man.</hi> If in a word, God did not abound in Goodneſs, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Compaſſion, more eaſily to be moved and excited than thoſe Human Paſſions that bear ſome <hi>Analogy</hi> to them. Next to <hi>Converſation with God by Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Converſation of good Men</hi> does wonderfully contribute to the building us up in Faith and Vertue. How does the Senſe and Experience of ſuch as deſerve our eſteem and affection, ſettle and eſtabliſh our Judgment when they concur with us? How does their Knowledge enlighten us, their Reaſon ſtrengthen our Faith, and their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple enflame us with Emulation. A pious Friendſhip renders Religion it ſelf more engaging: It Sanctifies our very Diverſions and Recreations, and makes them miniſter to Vertue; it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:29455:82"/>
minds us when we are forgetful, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and encourages us; when we faint and tire, reproves and corrects us when we give back, and recalls us into the right path, when we go out of it. This <hi>is,</hi> or this <hi>ſhould</hi> be, the buſineſs of <hi>Converſation,</hi> the end and advantage of <hi>Friendſhip:</hi> We ſhould be often <hi>talking</hi> together of the things of God, <hi>communicating</hi> and laying open the ſtate of our Souls, our Fears, our Hopes, our improvements and defects; we ſhould <hi>watch</hi> over one another, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> and <hi>ſupport</hi> one another; our <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> ſhould always miniſter new warmth, or new ſtrength to our Holy Faith and Love. But among <hi>all</hi> the <hi>means of Grace,</hi> there is <hi>no one</hi> does ſo much <hi>corroborate</hi> and <hi>nouriſh</hi> the Soul of Man as the <hi>Holy Euchariſt.</hi> How many wiſe and Impartial Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons does the <hi>Preparation</hi> for it occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? What unfeigned Humility, and what a profound Awe of the Divine Majeſty, does a previous <hi>Self-Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> beget in us? What a tender ſenſe of the Divine Love does the <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation</hi> of the whole Myſtery enkindle? What Firmneſs and Reſolution do we
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:29455:83"/>
derive from freſh <hi>Vows</hi> and repeated <hi>Engagements;</hi> and theſe offer'd up with ſo much <hi>Solemnity.</hi> And how much, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the Habit of Holineſs improved by that <hi>ſpiritual Pleaſure,</hi> which the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>Aſſurances</hi> of Grace and Salvation work in us, by that <hi>Awe</hi> and Holy <hi>Fear</hi> which the whole action leaves behind on our Minds, and the <hi>Zeal, Vigilance,</hi> and <hi>Circumſpection</hi> it obliges us to for the time following: Not to mention here, how the Participation of this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> obliges us to a moſt ſolemn <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus, of Brotherly Love and Charity, and the Hope of Immortality and Glory. <hi>Here,</hi> in a word, we prepare to meet <hi>God,</hi> as we would do in Death and Judgment; <hi>here</hi> we make an open Profeſſion of our Holy Faith, renounce the World and Fleſh, all our ſinful or vain deſires; devote our ſelves to the Service of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> and learn to expect Happineſs from nothing elſe, but the Merits and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of his Croſs. So profound is the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of this Inſtitution, that it evidently ſpeaks <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of it, and proclaims the too common <hi>neglect</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:29455:83"/>
of it in moſt parts of <hi>this Nation,</hi> an <hi>in-excuſable</hi> Sin and Folly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>Third end</hi> of <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion, is, the <hi>raiſing</hi> and <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Holy</hi> and <hi>Devout Affections.</hi> I know not why <hi>Paſſion</hi> is ſo commonly undervalued and diſparaged in <hi>Religion,</hi> unleſs they who thus treat it, mean nothing by it, but a ſhort-liv'd and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial commotion of the Mind, which leaves no print or reliſh behind it, and is preſently ſucceeded by Sin and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Holy Paſſion</hi> is the vigour and ſtrength of the Soul; 'tis the ſtate and frame of the Mind when it is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved and affected. And therefore to form to ones ſelf <hi>Religion</hi> deſtitute of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> is little better than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ones ſelf with one that is lazy, lukewarm, and lifeleſs. And though there be ſome <hi>Tempers</hi> very unapt to be <hi>moved,</hi> yet 'tis hard to imagine how even theſe can be wrought up to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, or that Reſolution be ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and continued without their being affected ſo throughly, as to feel either a <hi>real</hi> Paſſion, or ſomething very near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>approaching</hi> one. 'Tis an excellent Frame of Spirit, when the Soul is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:29455:84"/>
elevated, and tranſported into <hi>Holy Paſſion:</hi> And I find that all thoſe <hi>Vertues</hi> or rather <hi>Acts of Vertue</hi> which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the Life, and which are by all judg'd moſt Perfect, and Lovely, have moſt of <hi>Paſſion</hi> in them. How <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>Paſſionate</hi> was the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>David</hi> for his <hi>God!</hi> What Flame, what <hi>vehemence of Deſire</hi> was he moved by, when he cries out <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2. <hi>As the Heart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my Soul after thee, O God: My Soul thirſteth for God, for the living God.</hi> What awful Concuſſions and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations of Spirit did he feel, when he thus deſcribes his <hi>Fear, My Fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments,</hi> Pſal. 119.120. What afflictions of Soul, what tenderneſs of Heart do we meet with in the <hi>Repentance</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when <hi>He went forth and wept bitterly!</hi> Of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> or whoever that <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. was, when <hi>ſhe waſhed the Feet of our Saviour with her Tears, and wiped them with the Hairs of her Head!</hi> And of the <hi>Royal Pſalmiſt</hi> when he <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his Couch with his Tears,</hi> Pſal. 6.6. Nor were the Pleaſures of <hi>Aſſurance</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:29455:84"/>
leſs ſenſible and vehement then the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of <hi>Repentance,</hi> when the <hi>firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians rejoyced with Joy unſpeakable, and Hopes full of Glory.</hi> Shall I here add <hi>that</hi> Holy <hi>Indignation</hi> againſt <hi>Sin, that</hi> vehement deſire of making ſome <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> for it, which is the effect of Godly Sorrow, that <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Fervency</hi> of Spirit in the Service of God, which is the <hi>higheſt</hi> Character of <hi>Perfection</hi> it ſelf? Shall I call theſe <hi>Paſſions?</hi> I muſt not; for though they have the heat and agitation of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> they have in them the firmneſs and ſteadineſs of an <hi>Habit.</hi> And I wiſh with all my Heart, that all thoſe other excellent <hi>Affections</hi> of Soul, which I before named, could be rendered <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Habitual.</hi> The <hi>nearer</hi> we come to <hi>this,</hi> undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the <hi>Perfecter.</hi> I doubt Mortality is incapable of any ſuch height: But the more <hi>frequent</hi> as well as the more vehement and fervent, the <hi>better</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly. For great is the Force and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Holy Paſſion:</hi> the flame of <hi>Love</hi> refines our Nature and Purifies it from all its Droſs; the Tears of a <hi>Godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> extinguiſh all our carnal and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Luſts, and the Agitations of <hi>Fear</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:29455:85"/>
preſerve the chaſtity and purity of the Soul. 'Tis plain then, that our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ought to be animated by <hi>Holy Paſſions,</hi> that the more frequent and natural theſe grow, the more <hi>Perfect</hi> we are; that being the moſt excellent frame of Spirit, when we are moſt apt to be ſenſibly and throughly <hi>affected</hi> by Divine Truths. By what <hi>Means</hi> we may attain to this, is <hi>now</hi> briefly to be conſidered. 'Tis certain, that great and Important, wonderful and glorious <hi>Truths</hi> will not fail to affect us, and that throughly, unleſs Luſt or Infidelity have render'd us ſtupid and impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And that <hi>Goſpel Truths</hi> are <hi>ſuch,</hi> is no doubt at all, let the Conviction be full, the Repreſentation lively, and the <hi>Truth</hi> will do its work. 'Tis for want of ſuch circumſtances and ſuch ſenſible Notions of an Object as may ſtrike the Imagination; for want of cloſe and particular Applications, when <hi>Divine Truths</hi> do not move us. This now does not only call us to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Meditation</hi> of the moſt <hi>Affecting</hi> Subjects, the Majeſty and Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God; the Sufferings of Chriſt, Death and Judgment, Heaven and Hell;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:29455:85"/>
but it ſhews alſo, how to model and form our <hi>Meditations,</hi> that they prove not cold and ſluggiſh. Let the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Thoughts be deſcribed by the moſt <hi>ſenſible</hi> Images or Reſemblances, let it be clad with the moſt <hi>natural</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, let it be made as <hi>particular</hi> as it can, by fixing its Eye <hi>upon</hi> us, and pointing its Motion <hi>towards</hi> us; but above all, and in the firſt place, let the <hi>Proof</hi> of it be clear and ſtrong. <hi>Prayer</hi> is an Exerciſe very apt to move the <hi>Paſſion:</hi> The Mind having diſengaged it ſelf from all Earthly and Bodily Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections is prepared for the impreſſion of <hi>Truth</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of God;</hi> it draws nearer into the Preſence of God, and the ſenſe of this ſheds an awful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence upon it; it has a clearer, calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more ſerious <hi>View</hi> of Divine Things, then when it is obſcured and diſturbed by worldly Objects. In a word, <hi>Meditation</hi> is in <hi>this</hi> Exerciſe ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd more <hi>ſolemn</hi> and more <hi>particular;</hi> and when the Holy Fire is kindled in the Soul, it dilates and diffuſes it ſelf more and more, till the ſtrength of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the vehemence of Holy Love, tranſcending the weakneſs of this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:29455:86"/>
Nature, we <hi>faint</hi> under the <hi>Paſſions</hi> that we cannot <hi>bear.</hi> The <hi>Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> is an Holy Rite, wonderfully adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to raiſe excellent <hi>Paſſions: Here</hi> Chriſt is, as it were, <hi>ſet forth Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied amongst us;</hi> we ſee His <hi>Body</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and His <hi>Blood</hi> poured forth; <hi>here</hi> with a devout Joy we receive and embrace Him by Faith and Love in thoſe <hi>Symbols</hi> of His Body and Blood, and <hi>Pledges</hi> of His Love. The <hi>Soul</hi> muſt be very <hi>ill prepared,</hi> it muſt have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imperfect Notions of Sin and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Croſs of Chriſt, Grace and Salvation, which is not ſenſible of a <hi>Crow'd</hi> of Holy <hi>Paſſions</hi> ſpringing up in it at <hi>this Sacrament. Hymns</hi> and <hi>Pſalms</hi> have, by I know not what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Magick,</hi> a peculiar Force and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration upon a pious Mind. <hi>Divine Poetry</hi> has a noble elevation of Thoughts it does not deviſe and counterfeit <hi>Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but only <hi>vents</hi> thoſe which it <hi>feels;</hi> and theſe are pure and lovely, kindled from above. Therefore are all its Characters natural, its Deſcriptions lively, its Language moving and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful; and all is ſo directly ſuited to a <hi>Devout</hi> Mind, that it preſently enters,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:29455:86"/>
it, moves, and actuates it, inſpires and informs it with the very <hi>Paſſions</hi> it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes. And though all good Men are not <hi>equally</hi> mov'd in this Duty, yet all, I believe, are <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi> mov'd. It was very much the buſineſs of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and all of <hi>Prophetick Education;</hi> our <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples</hi> practis'd it frequently; it was ever a great part of <hi>Religious Joy,</hi> and one of the greateſt Pleaſures of pious <hi>Retirement:</hi> And I wiſh from my Heart the eſteem of it were revived in <hi>our</hi> Days; I perſwade my ſelf it would add much to the <hi>Warmth</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of Devotion, it would contribute to introduce <hi>Religion</hi> into our <hi>Families;</hi> and for ought I know, into our very <hi>Recreations</hi> and <hi>Friendſhips.</hi> And this minds me, that as I have under every <hi>foregoing Head,</hi> taken notice of the Advantages of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> ſo I ſhould not forget it <hi>here.</hi> This has a lively influence upon our Minds, and always kindles in the Soul a gentle heat. And did we but accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom our ſelves to <hi>entertain</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Diſcourſe about another World; did we mingle the <hi>Praiſes of God</hi> with the Feaſts and Joys of Life,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:29455:87"/>
did we retire to our <hi>Country-Houſes</hi> to contemplate the variety and riches of Divine Wiſdom and Bounty in thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Scenes of Pleaſure which the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> affords, and did we now and then invite our <hi>Friends</hi> to joyn with us in offering up <hi>Halelujahs</hi> to God on this account, what Brightneſs and Serenity, what Calm and Pleaſure, would this diffuſe through all our Souls, through all our Days! To this that I have ſaid touching the exciting <hi>Holy Paſſions,</hi> I will only add one <hi>Obſervation,</hi> formed upon thoſe words of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Jam. 5.13. <hi>Is any among you afflicted? Let him Pray, is any merry? Let him ſing Pſalms,</hi> That <hi>Religion</hi> muſt be accommodated to <hi>Nature,</hi> and that devout <hi>Paſſions</hi> will ſoon ſhoot up, when they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted upon a <hi>Natural</hi> Stock. With which I will joyn this <hi>other,</hi> That ſince we are moſt affected by ſuch truths as are moſt particular, circumſtantiated, and ſenſible, and therefore imprint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more eaſily and deeply on our imagination; for this Reaſon, I ſhould recommend the <hi>Reading</hi> the <hi>Lives</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>excellent Perſons,</hi> were they not generally writ ſo, that we have
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:29455:87"/>
reaſon to deſire ſomewhat more of the Spirit of <hi>Piety</hi> in the <hi>Learned,</hi> and more of <hi>Judgment</hi> in the <hi>Pious,</hi> who have employed their Pens on this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. The immediate <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi> are, the <hi>ſubduing the Pride of the Heart,</hi> and the <hi>reducing the Appetites of the Body.</hi> By <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> I here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand whatever <hi>voluntary Rigours</hi> we impoſe on our <hi>ſelves,</hi> or whatever <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Restraints</hi> we lay upon our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Enjoyments.</hi> And when I ſay that the <hi>Humiliation</hi> of the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>ſubjection</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> are the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Ends of <hi>both,</hi> I do not exclude any <hi>other</hi> which may be <hi>involved</hi> in theſe, or <hi>reſult</hi> from them. Now, of what <hi>Importance</hi> theſe two things are, I need not ſhew. For ſince all Sin is diſtingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed in Scripture into the filthineſs of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> it is plain, that the <hi>Pride</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the <hi>Lust</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> are the <hi>two</hi> great cauſes of all Immorality and Uncleanneſs. And therefore, theſe are the <hi>two</hi> great <hi>Ends</hi> which the Wiſe and Good have ever had in their <hi>Eye</hi> in all their Acts
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:29455:88"/>
of <hi>Self-denial</hi> and <hi>Mortification.</hi> This is ſufficiently atteſted by the Example of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 131. <hi>Lord, I am not high minded: I have no proud looks. I do not exerciſe my ſelf in great matters; which are too high for me. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain my Soul, and keep it low, like as a Child that is weaned from his Mother: Yea, my Soul is even as a weaned Child.</hi> And from that other of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.25, 26, 27. <hi>And every one that ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for the Maſtery, is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Crown, but we an incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I therefore ſo run, not as uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: So fight I, not as one that beateth the Air: But I keep under my Body, and bring it into ſubjection; leſt that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt-away.</hi> Whoever thus mortifies the <hi>Pride</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> whoever thus brings under the <hi>Body,</hi> will ſoon find himſelf truly ſet <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>Master</hi> of himſelf and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: He will be able to <hi>run the way of God's Commandments,</hi> and to advance on ſwiftly towards <hi>Perfection,</hi> and the Pleaſure and Happineſs that attends it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:29455:88"/>And to <hi>attain</hi> theſe bleſſed <hi>Ends,</hi> I do not think that we need enſnare our Souls in the perpetual Bonds of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick Vows;</hi> I do not think that we are to expoſe our ſelves by any <hi>Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi> or <hi>Fantaſtick</hi> obſervances: There is, I ſay, <hi>no need</hi> of this; for we may, as oft as we ſhall ſee fit, retrench our Pleaſures, abate of the Shew, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Life; we may renounce our own Wills to comply with theirs, who cannot ſo well pretend, either to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Diſcretion: And if theſe things cannot be done in ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances without becoming <hi>Fools for Chriſt,</hi> that is, without that Tameneſs, that Condeſcenſion, that Diminution of our ſelves which will never comport with the Humours and the Faſhions of the World; here is ſtill the more room for <hi>Mortification,</hi> and for a nearer and more eminent Imitation of the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus:</hi> Provided ſtill we decline all Affectation of Singularity; and when we Practiſe any extraordinary inſtance of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> we be ever able to juſtifie it to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Judicious Perſons by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of ſome excellent End. <hi>Fasting</hi> indeed is plainly preſcribed in <hi>Scripture,</hi>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:29455:89"/>
and though the <hi>Obligation</hi> to it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to its Frequency and Meaſure be not the ſame on <hi>all,</hi> yet <hi>all</hi> ſhould ſome time or other Practiſe it, as far as the Rules of <hi>Chriſtian Prudence</hi> will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. And I have often thought, that <hi>Faſting</hi> ſhould generally conſiſt, rather in Abſtinence from <hi>pleaſing</hi> Meats, than from <hi>all;</hi> not the Food which <hi>nouriſhes</hi> our ſtrength, but that which <hi>gratifies</hi> the Palate, miniſtring moſt directly to Wantonneſs and Luxury.</p>
               <p>For the better Regulation of Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Diſcipline, I propoſe by way of Advice three things. 1. I do not think it beſt to bring our ſelves under any perpetual and unalterable ties in any inſtance of Self-denial: There is a Vertue in <hi>Enjoying</hi> the World as well as in <hi>Renouncing</hi> it; and 'tis as great an Excellence of Religion to know how to <hi>abound</hi> as how to <hi>ſuffer want:</hi> Nay what is more, all voluntary Auſterities are in order to give us a Power and Dominion over our ſelves in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral courſe of a proſperous Life; and Laſtly, I very much doubt, when once a Man has long and conſtantly <hi>accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> himſelf to any Rigour, whether it
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:29455:89"/>
                  <hi>continue</hi> to have much of <hi>Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in it, or whether it ſo effectually tend to promote our <hi>Spiritual Liberty,</hi> as it would if we did <hi>return</hi> to it but <hi>now</hi> and <hi>then</hi> as we ſaw occaſion. 2. We muſt not multiply <hi>unneceſſary</hi> Severities; and that no Man may think more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than really are, I obſerve here, that as there are very <hi>few</hi> who have not in their <hi>Nature</hi> very conſiderable <hi>Infirmities,</hi> ſo are there <hi>as few</hi> who have not in their <hi>Fortune</hi> very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Inconveniencies:</hi> And if they would apply themſelves to the <hi>Maſtering</hi> of both theſe as they ought, they would ſtand in <hi>leſs need</hi> of the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of Arbitrary Auſterities. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things too <hi>trifling</hi> to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, which yet do prove ſufficient to diſturb the quiet of moſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray them to many Paſſions and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies: Nay, the weakneſſes of good Men are ſometimes fed by Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of very little moment. Now to <hi>ſurmount</hi> theſe Temptations, and to frame and accommodate the Mind to bear the little ſhocks and juſtles, which we daily meet with, without any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure or Diſpleaſure, is a matter
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:29455:90"/>
of great <hi>uſe</hi> to the Tranquility of Life, and the Maturity of Vertue. To be able to <hi>bear</hi> the Pride of one and the Stupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of another; one while to encounter Rudeneſs, another while Neglect, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being <hi>moved</hi> by either; to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to Noiſe, Diſorder and the Diſtraction of many little Affairs, when one is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally a lover of Quietneſs and Order, or when the Mind is intent upon things of Importance; in one word, to <hi>digeſt</hi> the perpetual diſappointments which we meet with, both in Buſineſs and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and in all the little Projects which not the Elegant and Ingenious only, but People of all Stations and all Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities purſue; to <hi>ſuffer</hi> all the Humours and Follies, the Errors, Artifices, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decencies and Faults of thoſe we have to do with, with that <hi>Temper</hi> we ought, that is with a <hi>Calmneſs</hi> which proceeds not from an unconcernment for the good of others, but a juſt Dominion over our own Spirits; <hi>This</hi> is a great <hi>Height;</hi> and to train our ſelves up to it daily with much Patience, Vigilence, and application of Mind is the <hi>beſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</hi> Though I do not mean hereby to exclude all <hi>voluntary Impoſitions;</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:29455:90"/>
for in order to <hi>Master</hi> the Evils which we cannot avoid, it may be of good uſe now and then to form the Mind by <hi>voluntary Trials</hi> and Difficulties of our own chooſing. 3. Laſtly, we muſt ever have a care not to looſe the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> for the <hi>Shadow,</hi> not to reſt in the <hi>Means,</hi> and neglect the <hi>End;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much taken up in <hi>Diſcipline</hi> without producing any <hi>Fruits</hi> of it. For this is taking much pains to little purpoſe; travelling much without making any Progreſs. But much more muſt we take care in the <hi>next</hi> place, that the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> we put our ſelves upon do not produce any <hi>ill Fruit.</hi> To which end, we muſt carefully obſerve <hi>three</hi> things. 1. That we keep to that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> which Spiritual <hi>Prudence</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; neither expoſing nor entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling our ſelves, nor diſcouraging others by <hi>Exceſſes</hi> and <hi>Extravagancies.</hi> 2. That our <hi>Self-denial</hi> never betray us into <hi>Pride</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitableneſs;</hi> for if it tempt us to over-rate our ſelves and deſpiſe others, this is a flat <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction</hi> to one of the main Ends of Chriſtian Diſcipline, which is, the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi> of the <hi>Heart.</hi> 3. That we
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:29455:91"/>
ever preſerve, nay, increaſe the <hi>Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> of our Minds; for whatever makes us ſour and moroſe, or peeviſh and unſociable, makes us certainly ſo much worſe: And inſtead of begetting in us nearer Reſemblances of the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature, gives us a very ſtrong tincture of a <hi>Diveliſh</hi> one. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> therefore in the Life of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony the Hermite</hi> obſerves, amongſt other his great Vertues, That after Thirty Years ſpent in a ſtrange kind of retired and ſolitary Life, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. He did not appear to his Friends with a ſullen or ſavage, but with an obliging, ſociable <hi>Air:</hi> And there is indeed but little reaſon, why the <hi>Look</hi> ſhould be lowring and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, when the <hi>Heart</hi> is filled with Joy and Charity, Goodneſs, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. A Serene open <hi>Countenance,</hi> and a chearful, grave <hi>Deportment,</hi> does beſt ſuit the Tranquility, Purity, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Chriſtian Mind.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>Laſtly, Some</hi> kinds of <hi>Life,</hi> are better ſuited and accommodated to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:29455:91"/>
the great <hi>Ends</hi> of Religion and Vertue than <hi>others.</hi> I ſhall not here enter into an Examination of the Advantages or Diſadvantages there are in the <hi>ſeveral kinds of Life</hi> with reference to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The ſetling <hi>this</hi> and ſeveral <hi>other</hi> things relating to it was one main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of my <hi>last Book.</hi> All therefore that I have <hi>here</hi> to do is but to make one plain <hi>Inference</hi> from all that has been advanced in <hi>this Chapter.</hi> If <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> cannot be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without a frequent and ſerious <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of our ſelves to the <hi>Means</hi> here inſiſted on, then 'tis plain, that we ought to caſt our <hi>Lives,</hi> if we can, into ſuch a <hi>Method</hi> that we may be in a <hi>capacity</hi> to do this. To ſpeak more particularly and cloſely, ſince <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Holy Converſation,</hi> are ſo neceſſary to <hi>quicken</hi> the <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, excite</hi> our <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and <hi>fortifie</hi> our <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> it is evident that it is as neceſſary ſo to model and form our Lives, that we may have time enough to beſtow on theſe. For they, whoſe Minds and Time are taken up by the <hi>World</hi> have very little leiſure for things of <hi>this</hi> Nature, and are very little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:29455:92"/>
to them, and as ill qualified for them. As to <hi>Converſation,</hi> as the World goes now, 'tis not to be expected that it ſhould have in it any reliſh of Piety, unleſs between ſuch as have entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a cloſe and ſtrict <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> But the <hi>Worldly Man</hi> is a ſtranger to true <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> 'tis too ſacred, too delicate a thing for a Mind, devoted to the <hi>World</hi> to be capable of. A regard to Intereſt, to ſome outward Forms and Decencies; the gratification of ſome natural Inclination, the neceſſity of ſome kind of Diverſion and Enjoyment, may invite him to more <hi>Familiarity</hi> with ſome, than others. But 'tis hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there ſhould be any thing in ſuch <hi>Combinations,</hi> of <hi>that</hi> which is the very Life and Soul of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> a ſincere and undeſigning Paſſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by mutual Confidences and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and ſupported and ſtrengthen'd by Vertue and Honour. As to <hi>Prayer, Men of buſineſs</hi> do I doubt oftner <hi>read</hi> or <hi>ſay Prayers,</hi> than <hi>Pray;</hi> for 'tis very hard to imagine that a Soul that grovels perpetually here upon Earth, that is inceſſantly Solicitous about the things of this World, and that enters abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:29455:92"/>
upon this Duty without any <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> ſhould immediately take Fire, be filled with Heavenly Vigour, and be tranſported with earneſt and impatient deſire of Grace and Glory. Ah! How hard is it for him who Hungers and Thirſts perpetually after the profits of <hi>this World,</hi> to <hi>Hunger and Thirſt after Righteouſneſs</hi> too! If ſuch Minds as <hi>theſe</hi> retain the Belief of a Providence, ſome awe of God, and ſome degree of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude towards Him, 'tis as <hi>much</hi> as may reaſonably be expected from them; and may <hi>this</hi> avail them as far as it <hi>can!</hi> Laſtly, as to <hi>Meditation,</hi> how can it be imagined that ſuch whoſe Minds and Bodies are fatigued and harraſſed by <hi>Worldly Buſineſs</hi> ſhould be much inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, or well prepared for it? How ſhould <hi>theſe</hi> Men form any Notion of a perfect and exalted Vertue, of devout and Heavenly Paſſion? What Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can they have of the Power and Joy of the Holy Ghoſt, of Poverty of Spirit, or Purity of Heart, or the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Love of God in our Souls? What Idea's can they entertain of an Heaven, or of Angelical Pleaſure and Beatitude? In a word, the <hi>Religion</hi> of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:29455:93"/>
Men intent upon <hi>this World,</hi> when they pretend to any, which too often they do not, conſiſt eſpecially in <hi>two</hi> things, in <hi>Abſtaining</hi> from <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> and <hi>doing the Works</hi> of their <hi>civil Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and how far they may be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of <hi>higher</hi> Obligations I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine not. Good God! What a <hi>Mercy</hi> it is to theſe poor Creatures, that 'tis the Faſhion of their Country, as well as a Precept of our Religion, to Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <hi>one</hi> Day in <hi>ſeven</hi> to the Service of God and their Souls! But have I not often <hi>taught,</hi> that <hi>Purity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> Converts the Works of a <hi>ſecular Calling</hi> into the <hi>Works of God?</hi> I <hi>have</hi> ſo, 'tis Univerſally taught, 'tis the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel; and therefore I ſhall never <hi>retract</hi> it; but ah! How <hi>hard</hi> a thing is it for a <hi>Worldly</hi> Man to <hi>maintain</hi> this <hi>Purity of Intention!</hi> How hard a thing is it for a Mind eaten up by the Love and Cares of <hi>this World</hi> to do all to the Honour of God! Though therefore I cannot <hi>retract</hi> this Doctrine, yet the <hi>longer</hi> I live, the <hi>more</hi> reaſon do I ſee, for <hi>qualifying</hi> and <hi>guarding</hi> it with this <hi>Caution:</hi> Let no Man that deſires to be <hi>Saved,</hi> much
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:29455:93"/>
leſs that deſires to be <hi>Perfect,</hi> take San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in <hi>Purity of Intention,</hi> while he ſuffers the Works of his <hi>ſecular Calling</hi> to ingroſs his Soul, and entirely Uſurp his Time. If <hi>ſecular Works</hi> exclude and thruſt out of doors ſuch as are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Religious,</hi> it will not be eaſie to conceive, how the Power of Godlineſs ſhould be maintained, how any wiſe Thoughts, or Heavenly Deſires ſhould be preſerved in ſuch Men; or how, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thoſe who have utterly given up themſelves to the <hi>wiſdom of this World,</hi> ſhould retain any true value for thoſe Maxims of the Goſpel, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the <hi>true Wiſdom, that is from above.</hi> All that I have ſaid againſt a Life of <hi>Buſineſs</hi> may, with equal or greater force, be urged againſt a Life of <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:</hi> I mean, <hi>that</hi> which they call <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Pleaſure:</hi> The <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> entangle and enſnare the Mind; the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> leave in it a peculiar reliſh, which continues long after the hurry, both of Pleaſure and Buſineſs is over. But all this while, I would not have what I have <hi>ſaid</hi> be <hi>extended</hi> further, then I deſign it, to raiſe <hi>ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> in <hi>Vertuous</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> Men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:29455:94"/>
of <hi>reforming</hi> the too eager Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of the <hi>Earthy</hi> to the things of this World.</p>

Great is the beauty and lovelineſs of an <hi>exalted</hi> Vertue, great the Honour and Authority of it; and a very happy Influence it has even upon our Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affairs: And to this may be added, the Peace and Tranquility of a wiſe Mind, ſanctified Affections, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Life. Beſides, the Love of <hi>God</hi> is boundleſs, and the Love of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſo too, and therefore I demand not a lazy, feeble, or unſteady Vertue; but
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:29455:94"/>
a ſtrong and vigorous one, a warm and active; ſuch as a true <hi>Faith,</hi> great <hi>Hopes,</hi> and a paſſionate <hi>Love</hi> do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally excite us to. To all this I might add, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God is always preſſing on and advancing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to communicate <hi>himſelf</hi> to us more and more plentifully, if we be not backward or negligent our ſelves. But theſe and many other <hi>Enforcements</hi> to the duty of <hi>Perfection,</hi> ſhould I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large on them, would ſwell this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi> to an intolerable bulk. Nor indeed is it neceſſary; for the 4th <hi>Chapter,</hi> where I treat of the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> does contain ſuch <hi>Motives</hi> to it, as are ſufficient to excite in any one that reads them, a moſt vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and thirſt after it. Here therefore all that I think fit to do, is, to put my <hi>Reader</hi> in mind of <hi>another Life:</hi> In the Glories and Pleaſures of which, I need not prove that the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man will have the greateſt ſhare. <hi>This</hi> is a <hi>Motive,</hi> that muſt never be out of the thoughts of the Man that will be <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> for <hi>three</hi> Reaſons, which I will but juſt mention.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:29455:95"/>1. Without <hi>another Life,</hi> we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver form any true Notion of a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Vertue. Sociable</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues may be ſupported by <hi>Temporal Motives,</hi> and fram'd and model'd by <hi>Worldly Conveniencies;</hi> but a <hi>Divine</hi> Vertue muſt be built upon a <hi>Divine</hi> Life, upon a <hi>Heavenly</hi> Kingdom. The Reaſon of this Aſſertion is plain; the <hi>Means</hi> muſt always bear Proportion to the <hi>End;</hi> where therefore the end is an Imperfect, Temporal Good, there needs no more then imperfect <hi>unfiniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Vertue to attain it; but where the the end is Heavenly and Immortal, the Vertue ought to be <hi>ſo</hi> too. Were there no <hi>other</hi> Life, the Standard and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Good or Evil to be found in Actions, would be their ſubſervien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the temporal Good or Evil of <hi>this</hi> World; and by a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, it would be impoſſible to prove any higher degrees of Poverty of Spirit, Purity of Heart, Charity and the like, to be truly <hi>Vertue,</hi> then what we could prove truly <hi>neceſſary</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Good, or guard us againſt the Evil, of <hi>this</hi> Life: And if ſo, 'tis ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to conclude what <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>beggarly</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:29455:95"/>
kind of Vertues would be produc'd from this ground.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Without <hi>another Life,</hi> all other <hi>Motives</hi> to <hi>Perfection</hi> will be inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. For though, generally ſpeaking, ſuch is the Contrivance of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that neither the common Good of civil <hi>Society,</hi> nor the more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Good of <hi>private</hi> Men, can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, or ſecured, without the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſociable and political <hi>Vertues;</hi> yet 'tis certain, that not only in many <hi>extraordinary</hi> Caſes, there would be no <hi>Reward</hi> at all for <hi>Vertue,</hi> if there were not one reſerved for it in <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World;</hi> but alſo in <hi>most</hi> Caſes, if there were not a <hi>future</hi> Pleaſure, that did infinitely out-weigh the enjoyments of <hi>this</hi> Life, Men would ſee no <hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>Perfection.</hi> For what ſhould raiſe them above the love of <hi>this</hi> World, if there were no <hi>other?</hi> Or above the love of the Body, if when they died they ſhould be no more for ever? And certainly our Minds would never be able to ſoar very high, nor ſhould we ever arrive at any Excellence or Perfection in any Action, if we were always under the influence of the love of the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Body.</hi>

               <p n="3">

How Importunately will a Man pray for the Pardon of Sin, whoſe Senſe, whoſe Soul, whoſe Imagination is ſtruck with a dread of being for ever divided from God, and excluded from the Joys and Vertues of the Bleſſed? How fervently will a Man pray for the Spirit of God, for the Increaſe of Grace, whoſe Thoughts are daily ſwallowed up with the Contemplation of an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and whoſe Mind is as fully poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of the certainty and the Glory of <hi>another World,</hi> as of the emptineſs and vanity of <hi>this?</hi> How natural, finally, will it be to be poor in Spirit, and to delight in all the Offices of an unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Humility, to that Man who has the Image of <hi>Jeſus waſhing the feet of his Diſciples,</hi> and a little after <hi>Aſcending</hi> up into <hi>Heaven,</hi> alway before him?</p>

            </head>
            <p>WHat the ſeveral <hi>Parts</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Perfection</hi> are, will be eaſily diſcerned by a very ſlight Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, either on the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> or the general <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Perfection</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready laid down. If we conſider <hi>Man,</hi> whoſe <hi>Perfection</hi> I am treating of, as it is plain that he is made up of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> ſo 'tis as plain that Moral <hi>Perfection</hi> relates to the <hi>Soul,</hi> as the chief ſubject of it, and to the <hi>Body</hi> no otherwiſe then as the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of that Righteouſneſs which is planted in the <hi>Soul.</hi> Now in the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man we find theſe three things; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Will,</hi> and <hi>Affections:</hi> In the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Accompliſhment of which Human <hi>Perfection</hi> muſt conſequently conſiſt. And if we enquire wherein this Improvement or Accompliſhment lies, 'tis a Truth ſo obvious that it will not need any proof, that <hi>Illumination</hi> is the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:29455:99"/>
Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> of the <hi>Affections.</hi> If, in the next place, we reflect upon the Deſcription I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given of Perfection, nothing is more evident than that to conſtitute a firm <hi>Habit</hi> of Righteouſneſs, three things are neceſſary: 1. The <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of our <hi>Duty,</hi> and our Obligations to it. 2. The <hi>Subduing</hi> our <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>Paſſions,</hi> that we may be enabled to perform it. Laſtly, not only a free, but warm and vigorous <hi>Proſecution</hi> of it. In the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe conſiſts <hi>Illumination;</hi> in the <hi>ſecond, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and in the <hi>third, Zeal.</hi> Upon the whole then 'tis evident, both from the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Perfection,</hi> and of <hi>Man,</hi> that I am now to treat in order of theſe three things, <hi>Illumination, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Zeal,</hi> as ſo many Eſſential <hi>Parts</hi> of Religious <hi>Perfection.</hi> Nor muſt I ſtop here, but muſt to thoſe three unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably add <hi>Humility:</hi> For whether we conſider the Sins of the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man's paſt Life, or the ſlips and defects of his beſt State; or whether we conſider Man's continual dependance upon God in all reſpects, but eſpecially in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Beginning, Progreſs, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:29455:99"/>
Conſummation of his <hi>Perfection;</hi> or whether, Laſtly, we conſider the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, and deficiency, not only of this or that Man's <hi>Perfection</hi> in particular, but of Human <hi>Perfection</hi> in general, we cannot but conclude, that nothing can become Mortal Man (even though all the Excellence Human Nature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of were United in one) better then <hi>Humility. Humility</hi> therefore muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and compleat, Religious <hi>Perfection;</hi> it muſt accompany the Chriſtian in every Stage of his ſpiritual Progreſs; it muſt Crown all his Actions, and add that Beauty and Excellence, that Grace and Luſtre to all his other Vertues, that is wholly neceſſary to render them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God.</p>
            <p>The general <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Perfection</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus reſolved into its <hi>Parts,</hi> 'tis plain I am now to Diſcourſe of <hi>each</hi> of theſe. And what I have to ſay on <hi>each,</hi> ought according to the ſtrict Rules of <hi>Method</hi> to be compriſed within the <hi>ſame</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But to conſult the <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> of my <hi>Reader,</hi> I ſhall ſlight this Nicety, and diſtribute my Thoughts into as <hi>many Chapters</hi> as I ſhall judge moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the caſe and ſupport of the <hi>Memory.</hi>

However, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honeſt Man hath a <hi>Clue</hi> by which he may eſcape out of this <hi>Labyrinth.</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> ſhines with bright and gracious Beams throughout all this Darkneſs: And if we will attend to it, we cannot wander into any dangerous miſtake. This deſcribes the ſtate of <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination</hi> very plainly to us; calling it ſometimes <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Faith,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Spirit of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Revelation.</hi> Next, it acquaints us with the <hi>Deſign</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of it; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to <hi>convert us from the power of Satan to the ſervice of the Living God,</hi> to Purifie and Sanctifie us, to enable us to <hi>approve the Holy acceptable and perfect Will of God,</hi> and in one word, <hi>to make us wiſe unto Salvation.</hi> Nay it procedes further, and points out to us particularly the <hi>Truths</hi> in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which <hi>Illumination</hi> conſiſts. Thus the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> reckons <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>

But all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to the ſame thing, and all the Deſcriptions of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> may be ſum'd up into that one, <hi>Job</hi> 28.28. <hi>Behold the fear of the Lord, that is Wiſdom, and to depart from evil is underſtanding.</hi> The <hi>New Testament</hi> tells us, <hi>this is Life Eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent:</hi> That <hi>Chriſt is the Way, the Truth, and the Life:</hi> That <hi>in Him are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge:</hi> That true Underſtanding conſiſts in <hi>knowing the Will of God; which Will is our Sanctification.</hi> And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> underſtands by <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he does, the penetrating into the Spirit and Myſtery, the Depths and

To conclude, we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily learn what ſort of <hi>Knowledge</hi> the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> recommends to us above all other, from thoſe <hi>Petitions</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> puts up for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and <hi>Colloſians.</hi> For the <hi>Former</hi> he Prays thus; <hi>That the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the Spirit of Wiſdom and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation in the knowledge of him; the Eyes of your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, that ye may know, what is the Hope of his Calling, and what the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in the Saints, and what is the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Power to us-ward who Believe, according to the working of his Mighty Power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the Dead, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:29455:102"/>
ſet him at his own Right Hand in the Heavenly places,</hi> &amp;c. Eph. 1.17, 18, 19, 20. For the <hi>Latter</hi> thus: <hi>That ye might be filled with the Knowledge of his Will, in all Wiſdom and Spiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing, being fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in every good work, and increaſing in the Knowledge of God,</hi> &amp;c. Col. 1.9, 10. If from theſe and the like <hi>Texts</hi> we form a general <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Illumination,</hi> it will be this: <hi>Illumination</hi> is a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> conſiſting, in the aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or relinquiſhing thoſe <hi>Errors,</hi> which deprave and pervert our Affections, and undermine and ſupplant the Empire and Authority of Reaſon; and in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining and embracing thoſe <hi>Truths,</hi> which purifie the one, and reſtore and eſtabliſh the other: All this in order to entitle us to the Favour of God, and a bleſſed Eternity.

And this ſure is the firſt thing neceſſary to the <hi>Perfecting</hi> the Soul of Man.

                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:29455:104"/>
which deceive and miſlead the Mind, and pervert Life. <hi>What</hi> theſe were in the <hi>Jew,</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and what they are at <hi>this</hi> day in <hi>us,</hi> it is eaſie enough to diſcern. The <hi>Mind</hi> of Man, as far as I can obſerve, is naturally <hi>prone</hi> to <hi>Religious</hi> Worſhip. Not only the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the wonderful Mechaniſm and contrivance of the <hi>World,</hi> and of <hi>Events,</hi> ſtrange, ſuddain, and unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but alſo the Conſcience of his own <hi>Impotence,</hi> and <hi>Obnoxiouſneſs,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining him to the Belief, and prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſeek the Patronage, of an <hi>Inviſible, All-ſufficient</hi> Power. In the next place, the Mind of <hi>Man</hi> is ever prone, to propoſe to him ſome great, ſome ſoveraign <hi>Good;</hi> in which he may acquieſce, and by which he may ſecure himſelf, as well as he can, againſt the Indigence and Poverty of his <hi>Nature,</hi> and the Changes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, the Diſaſters, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, to which this <hi>Mortal State</hi> is expoſed. Theſe are two things of that Importance, that no man can err in them, but the Error muſt prove fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to his Repoſe. He that ſets up to himſelf for his ultimate End, an <hi>empty</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:29455:105"/>
and <hi>uncertain Good,</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Solid</hi> and <hi>Eternal</hi> one, muſt needs be as miſerably deluded and diſappointed, as <hi>he</hi> muſt, who ſets up to himſelf a <hi>falſe God,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>true;</hi> or goes about to endear and recommend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the <hi>true,</hi> by a <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious</hi> Worſhip. Now in theſe points, the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> were <hi>miſerably,</hi> though not <hi>equally</hi> miſtaken. The <hi>Gentile</hi> worſhipped <hi>Devils,</hi> inſtead of <hi>God:</hi> Their <hi>Myſteries</hi> were either ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, or cruel; their <hi>Religion</hi> did oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner incourage Sin, than Vertue. And as to their ſoveraign <hi>Good,</hi> their Hearts were ſet upon <hi>this World,</hi> upon the Pomp and Pleaſure, upon the Eaſe and Honour of it; and they had either none, or very dark, and uncertain Proſpects beyond the <hi>Grave:</hi> All beyond it was an unknown Region, full of Fables and idle Phantoms. The <hi>Jews,</hi> though they enjoy'd the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> and generally preſerved the Worſhip of one <hi>true</hi> and <hi>living God,</hi> yet were they not free from very deplorable Errors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to theſe points: They ſeemed, to have turned the <hi>true God</hi> into an <hi>Idol,</hi> and to have entertained ſome <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:29455:105"/>
of <hi>Him</hi> very repugnant to <hi>his Nature:</hi> they looked upon him as <hi>the God of the Jews, not of the Gentiles;</hi> as a <hi>Reſpecter of Perſons,</hi> as fond, and <hi>partial</hi> to their Nation; and as delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Religion, made up of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous <hi>Rites,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Obſervances. And this could not but have a very ſad influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>Religion,</hi> as it really had: The <hi>Holineſs</hi> which is truly acceptable to God, being neglected, and aboliſhed; and <hi>Sadduciſm,</hi> or <hi>Phariſaiſm,</hi> i. e. <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality,</hi> or <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> introduced in the room of it. And as to their ultimate <hi>End,</hi> or ſupream <hi>Good,</hi> the <hi>Sadducees</hi> denied the <hi>Reſurrection, Angels,</hi> and <hi>Spirits;</hi> and therefore 'tis not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, they ſhould entertain any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign above the Pleaſure of the <hi>Body.</hi> And though the <hi>Phariſees</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Angels,</hi> and a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> yet can we not diſcern, that they had a real value for any thing, beſides the Honour, Power, and Wealth of this <hi>World.</hi> And no wonder; ſince they could, upon their <hi>Principles,</hi> ſatisfie themſelves in a <hi>Religion,</hi> which had nothing of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Purity,</hi> or ſolid <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> in it.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:29455:106"/>
So that upon the whole, the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> were alike wicked: Only the Wickedneſs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> had this <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation</hi> in it above that of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> that they enjoy'd the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> and the Favour of a peculiar <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> This being the ſtate of <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which lay upon the Face of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> World, our <hi>Lord,</hi> who was to be <hi>a Light to lighten the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and the Glory of his People</hi> Iſrael, advanced, and eſtabliſhed in the World that Doctrine, which directly tends to diſpel theſe Errors, and reſcue Mankind from the Miſery that attends them. For all that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> contains may be reduced to theſe <hi>three</hi> Heads: <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Aſſertion of <hi>one</hi> only true <hi>God;</hi> with a bright and full <hi>Revelation</hi> of his Divine <hi>Attributes</hi> and <hi>Perfection. Secondly,</hi> an Account of the <hi>Will</hi> of God, or the <hi>Worſhip</hi> he delights in, which is a <hi>Spiritual</hi> one, together with ſuitable <hi>Means,</hi> and <hi>Motives;</hi> in which laſt is contained a full <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>Man's</hi> ſupream <hi>Happineſs. Thirdly,</hi> the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus; through whom we have acceſs with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:29455:106"/>

The <hi>Deſign</hi> of this glorious Manifeſtation was to <hi>open</hi> Mens <hi>Eyes,</hi> to <hi>turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan to the Living God: That they might obtain Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> and an <hi>Inheritance of Glory.</hi> Theſe then are the <hi>truths</hi> which <hi>Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi> the <hi>Gentile</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> World: And theſe are the <hi>truths</hi> which muſt <hi>Illuminate us</hi> at <hi>this</hi> day. Theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel all deſtructive <hi>Errors,</hi> that lead us to Vice, or Miſery: Theſe point out our ſupream <hi>Felicity,</hi> and the direct <hi>way</hi> to it: Theſe open and enlarge the <hi>Eye</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> enable it to diſtinguiſh, and judge with an unerring <hi>Exactneſs,</hi> between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> between <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial</hi> and <hi>Superficial, Temporal,</hi> and <hi>Eternal</hi> Good. And I wiſh from my Soul, whatever <hi>Light</hi> we pretend to at <hi>this Day,</hi> we were well grounded and eſtabliſhed in <hi>theſe Truths.</hi> I doubt not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our <hi>Belief</hi> of <hi>one God,</hi> and <hi>one Mediator;</hi> and notwithſtanding we

For is <hi>this</hi> the imitation of <hi>Jeſus?</hi> Is this to walk as <hi>he</hi> walked in the World? Can this be the Deportment of Men to whom the World and the Body is Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified? Can ſuch a Life as this is flow from thoſe Divine Fountains, <hi>Faith, Love,</hi> and <hi>Hope?

our main <hi>End,</hi> that we ſet a wrong <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue</hi> upon <hi>things,</hi> and that whatever we talk of an <hi>Eternity,</hi> we look upon this <hi>preſent</hi> World as our <hi>portion,</hi> and moſt valuable <hi>Good?</hi> For can ſuch a tender concern for, ſuch an eager purſuit after <hi>temporal</hi> things flow from, nay conſiſt with, <hi>purity of Heart,</hi> and <hi>poverty of Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and a <hi>Deſire of Heaven?</hi> Whoever then will be <hi>Perfect,</hi> or <hi>Happy,</hi> muſt carefully avoid both theſe <hi>Errors:</hi> He muſt never think that <hi>Religion</hi> can ſubſiſt, without the ſtrength and vigour of our <hi>Affections:</hi> Or that the Bent and Vigour of our <hi>Souls</hi> can be pointed towards <hi>God,</hi> and yet the <hi>Air</hi> of our <hi>Deportment</hi> and <hi>Converſation</hi> be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, ſenſual, and vain, conformed even to a <hi>Pagan Pride,</hi> and <hi>ſhew</hi> of <hi>Life. Next,</hi> he muſt never cheriſh in himſelf the love of <hi>this World:</hi> He muſt never look upon himſelf other than <hi>a Stranger and Pilgrim</hi> in it: He muſt never be fond of the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of it: He muſt never form vain <hi>Deſigns</hi> and <hi>Projects</hi> about it; nor look upon the beſt things in it, as <hi>ingredients</hi> of our <hi>Happineſs,</hi> but only as <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>Vertue,</hi> or ſhort <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſts</hi> and <hi>Refreſhments</hi> in our Journey.

And what can more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually reconcile and ingratiate us with <hi>God,</hi> than ſincere, univerſal <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Mediation</hi> of his dearly Beloved <hi>Son?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Third</hi> Character of <hi>Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Truth</hi> is, that they are <hi>Pleaſant</hi> and <hi>Agreeable</hi> to the Soul. Hence it is that the <hi>Royal Pſalmiſt</hi> pronounces the <hi>Word of God ſweeter than the Honey, and the Honey Comb:</hi> that he aſcribes to it <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Joy;</hi> For he tell us, that <hi>it rejoyces the Heart,</hi> that <hi>it enlightens the Eyes.</hi> And accordingly we find the true Servants of God, not only
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:29455:110"/>
continually bleſſing and praiſing God in the <hi>Temple,</hi> but magnifying him by <hi>Pſalms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> in their <hi>Priſons,</hi> and <hi>rejoycing</hi> in the midſt of <hi>Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But when I reckon <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Delight</hi> amongſt the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I muſt add, that there is a vaſt difference, between the <hi>Fits</hi> and <hi>Flaſhes</hi> of <hi>Mirth,</hi> and the ſerenity of a <hi>Fixt</hi> and <hi>Habitual Delight;</hi> between the <hi>Titilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and the ſolid <hi>Joys</hi> of the <hi>Mind;</hi> and laſtly, between the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> of <hi>Fancy,</hi> and of <hi>Reaſon.</hi> And when I ſay, <hi>Illumination</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>pleaſant</hi> and <hi>agreeable Truths,</hi> I mean it of <hi>rational</hi> Pleaſure, an <hi>habitual</hi> Tranquility of the Mind: And then the Matter is beyond Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Whatever <hi>Truths</hi> do contribute to promote <hi>this,</hi> the Study and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of <hi>them,</hi> muſt be our true <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> Joy, when 'tis ſolid and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, does enlarge and exalt the Mind of Man: 'Tis, as it were, <hi>Health to the Navel, and Marrow to the Bones;</hi> it renders us more thankful to God, more kind and courteous to Man. 'Tis an excellent <hi>Preparation</hi> to invite more <hi>Plentifully</hi> Influxes of the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi>

Life; and they invite him to hope for Glories and Pleaſures, in <hi>another,</hi> far above any thing that <hi>the Heart of Man can conceive.

No knowledge of <hi>Arts</hi> or <hi>Sciences,</hi> and much leſs the moſt exquiſite knowledge of all the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Darkneſs,</hi> can pretend

to an Eternal <hi>Reward.</hi> A ſhort and impure <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and a tranſcient <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> is all that <hi>this</hi> ſort of <hi>Knowledge</hi> can beſtow; and very often, inſtead of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Profit,</hi> it requites its Diſciples with <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Trouble.</hi> The <hi>Goſpel</hi> only contains thoſe <hi>Truths,</hi> which confer <hi>Life and Immortality</hi> on thoſe that Believe, and Obey them. 'Tis the <hi>Goſpel</hi> alone that teaches us, how we are to gain the Love and Favour of <hi>God;</hi> and 'tis <hi>God</hi> alone who <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns</hi> the viſible and inviſible <hi>World.

                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:29455:112"/>
but <hi>love</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> who after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the vital Union betwixt <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> is able to confer <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> on <hi>both</hi> to all <hi>Eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I conſidered the <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters</hi> of <hi>Illuminating Truths.</hi> And the <hi>whole</hi> of what I have ſaid amounts to theſe <hi>two</hi> things. 1. There are <hi>Truths</hi> of very <hi>different</hi> kinds: <hi>Truths</hi> that are of <hi>no uſe;</hi> ſuch are thoſe which are either <hi>trifling</hi> or meerly <hi>notional,</hi> and can have no Influence on Human Life: <hi>Truths</hi> that are of <hi>ill uſe;</hi> ſuch are thoſe of which conſiſts the Arts of <hi>Senſuality, Avarice, Vanity</hi> and <hi>Ambition: Theſe</hi> are to be <hi>detested,</hi> the <hi>former</hi> to be <hi>contemned,</hi> by all that ſeek after true <hi>Wiſdom. Again,</hi> there are <hi>Truths</hi> of an <hi>inferior uſe;</hi> ſuch as concern our <hi>Fortunes,</hi> our <hi>Relations,</hi> our <hi>Bodies;</hi> and theſe may be allowed their <hi>proper place,</hi> and a <hi>reaſonable Value.</hi> But the <hi>Truths</hi> which concern the Peace, and Pleaſure, and Strength, and Liberty of our <hi>Souls;</hi> which procure us the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Grace</hi> of his <hi>Spirit;</hi> the <hi>Truths,</hi> in a word, which ſecure our <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Eternal</hi> Happineſs; theſe are <hi>Illuminating Truths,</hi> theſe have a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:29455:113"/>
                  <hi>tranſcendent</hi> worth, and <hi>ineſtimable</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, or Uſefulneſs, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can never be too <hi>dear</hi> to us. 2. Since the great <hi>Characters</hi> of <hi>Illuminating Truths</hi> do exactly <hi>fit</hi> the <hi>Goſpel of Jeſus,</hi> 'tis plain, that <hi>this</hi> is that <hi>Syſteme</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which we are to <hi>Study day and night; this</hi> is that <hi>Divine Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> whoſe <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> we muſt inceſſantly revolve and ponder. 'Tis not without reaſon, that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> beſtows ſuch glorious <hi>Elogies</hi> upon the <hi>word of God, Pſal.</hi> 19. and elſewhere: That he magnifies, one while the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick Excellence and Beauty, another while the Force and Efficacy of it; and ever and anon, enlarges himſelf upon the advantages, the unſpeakable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which reward the Meditation and Practice of it. <hi>Of all Perfections I have ſeen an end: But thy Commandments are exceeding broad. They are pure, they endure for ever; they enlighten the Eyes, and rejoyce the Heart. Moreover by them thy Servant is warned; and in keeping of them there is great Reward.</hi> That is, by them we are preſerved from all <hi>real Evil,</hi> and put in poſſeſſion of, or entitled to, all <hi>real Good.</hi> How
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:29455:113"/>
well did St. <hi>Peter</hi> anſwer, when our <hi>Lord</hi> asked his <hi>Diſciples, will ye alſo go from me? Lord, whither ſhall we go? Thou haſt the words of Eternal Life.</hi> And how wiſely did St. <hi>Paul</hi> reſolve, to <hi>know nothing but Chriſt Jeſus and him Crucified? For He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life;</hi> and in <hi>Him are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after all, as there is a <hi>Form of Godlineſs,</hi> ſo there is a <hi>Form of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> without the <hi>power</hi> of it. The Knowledge of the <hi>ſame Truths,</hi> as I obſerved in the beginning, in <hi>different Perſons</hi> may be very <hi>different;</hi> as meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a very <hi>different Reception.</hi> Our <hi>Conceptions</hi> may be more clear, or confuſed, more lively, or faint, more perfect, or maimed: And our <hi>Aſſent</hi> may be ſtronger, or weaker. In <hi>ſome</hi> they may only float ſuperficially, in <hi>others</hi> they may penetrate deeper: And the Degrees of their <hi>Influence</hi> and <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> will be certainly proportioned to the different manner of their <hi>Reception.</hi> For this reaſon it will be neceſſary to the right underſtanding of a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> to diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the <hi>Nature</hi> of that <hi>Knowledge</hi> we muſt have of the <hi>Former Truths;</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:29455:114"/>
to ſhew, <hi>what</hi> ſort of <hi>Conception</hi> we muſt form of them, what kind of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> we muſt pay them, and what kind of <hi>Conſideration</hi> we muſt employ about them. As I have therefore laid down the <hi>Properties</hi> of thoſe <hi>Truths,</hi> ſo will I now lay down the <hi>Properties</hi> of that <hi>Knowledge of them,</hi> which is Eſſential to <hi>Illumination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Illuminating Knowledge</hi> muſt be deeply <hi>rooted.</hi> This our <hi>Saviour</hi> has taught us in that <hi>Parble,</hi> wherein he has obſerved to us, that the <hi>Seed which had not depth of Earth,</hi> as it <hi>ſoon ſprung up,</hi> ſo it <hi>ſoon withered</hi> and <hi>dryed away.</hi> We often know, or pretend to do ſo, the <hi>Rudiments</hi> of our Religion, without the <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> of it. We embrace <hi>Concluſions,</hi> without examining the <hi>Principles</hi> from whence they flow: and contrary to the advice of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi> we are <hi>unable to give a reaſon, to any one that asketh us of the Faith, and the Hope, that is in us.</hi> And then <hi>ours,</hi> is not properly <hi>Knowledge,</hi> but <hi>Opinion;</hi> 'tis not <hi>Faith,</hi> but <hi>Credulity:</hi> 'Tis not a firm <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> but an <hi>eaſie, cuſtomary</hi> Aſſent. And this is overthrown by every <hi>Temptation;</hi> defaced, or much
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:29455:114"/>
blur'd by every <hi>Atheiſtical ſuggeſtion,</hi> or <hi>Prophane Objection.</hi> Does the <hi>World</hi> or our <hi>Lust</hi> tempt us, as the <hi>Devil</hi> did our <hi>firſt Parents, ye ſhall not ſurely Die?</hi> how eaſily is that <hi>Faith</hi> ſhaken, which is <hi>no better founded?</hi> How eaſily is a Man induced to Hope, that <hi>Sin</hi> is not very <hi>fatal</hi> and <hi>pernicious,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> will eaſily be prevailed with to <hi>pardon</hi> it, that the <hi>Flames of Hell</hi> are <hi>Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and its <hi>Eternity</hi> a <hi>miſtaken</hi> Notion, and <hi>groundleſs</hi> Fancy, if he be ignorant of the true <hi>Reaſons</hi> of <hi>God's Wrath,</hi> and <hi>Indignation,</hi> which are founded in the very <hi>Nature of God</hi> and <hi>Sin?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the <hi>other</hi> hand, he that well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands <hi>both</hi> theſe; the Deformity, and Tendency of Sin, and the Holineſs, and the Purity, of the Divine Nature, cannot but <hi>diſcern</hi> an irreconcilable <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> between them; and be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that were there <hi>no Tribunal</hi> erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the <hi>Sinner,</hi> yet would <hi>Sin</hi> be its <hi>own Puniſhment;</hi> and that an intolerable <hi>Hell,</hi> conſiſting in the <hi>diſorder of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> an <hi>excluſion from God,</hi> &amp;c. would be the natural and neceſſary <hi>Iſſue</hi> of it. The <hi>ſum</hi> of this Argument <hi>is, that Knowledge,</hi> which has no deep <hi>root</hi> is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:29455:115"/>
to be overthrown by ever <hi>blaſt: That Faith</hi> which is little more than <hi>Credulity</hi> does very ſeldom ſtand againſt any very rude <hi>ſhock.</hi> Now the <hi>Grounds</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> are fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expounded in the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> And <hi>here</hi> eſpecially we muſt <hi>ſeek</hi> them. When I ſay <hi>this,</hi> I reject no <hi>Collateral</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, I refuſe no <hi>Foreign</hi> Aids, which contribute any thing to <hi>confirm</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie</hi> our Belief of <hi>Goſpel Truths.</hi> The <hi>Faith</hi> of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> did, in part at leaſt, depend upon the Evidence of <hi>ſenſe.</hi> Thomas, <hi>becauſe thou haſt ſeen thou haſt believed,</hi> Joh. 20.29. And ſo did that of the <hi>reſt</hi> of them, who were <hi>Eye witneſſes</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Aſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus.</hi> The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>one God,</hi> and a <hi>Judgment to come,</hi> may receive much <hi>light</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> from <hi>natural Reaſon:</hi> And whatever <hi>eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes</hi> a <hi>revealed Truth,</hi> will be ſo far from diminiſhing, that it will, increaſe the <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of it. All the <hi>Caution</hi> I think fit to give here is, that we be ſure that the Ground be Plain, and Firm, on which we build the Belief of an <hi>Illuminating Truth. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi> in many caſes, is clear and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:29455:115"/>
convictive: St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf amongſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> frequently appeals to <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> But too often we call our <hi>Fancy, Philoſophy;</hi> and obtrude upon the World, the wild and undigeſted <hi>Theories</hi> of a warm and confident <hi>Imagination,</hi> for new <hi>Diſcoveries.</hi> What ſtrange <hi>stuff</hi> was <hi>Gnoſtick Philoſophy once?</hi> What did it produce but the <hi>Corruption</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith?</hi> And what can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from <hi>Myſtick, Enthuſiastick Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi> or <hi>Divinity,</hi> in <hi>any</hi> Age, any Man may gueſs, without any deep Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration. Nor do I doubt but that all judicious and experienced Men, do as much deſpiſe and nauſeate the Blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures and Mixtures of pretended <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi> with our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Morals,</hi> as the World generally does, the <hi>ſubtilties</hi> and <hi>perplexities</hi> of the <hi>Schools.</hi> For my part, I can't endure, to have my <hi>Religion</hi> lean upon the rotten <hi>props</hi> of <hi>precarious</hi> Notions. I admire, I love, the <hi>Elevations</hi> and <hi>Enlargements</hi> of Soul: But I can have no value for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable <hi>Amuſements</hi> or <hi>Rambles</hi> of <hi>Fancy.</hi> An itch of <hi>Novelty</hi> or <hi>Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> has a Tincture in it of our <hi>Original Corruption.</hi> I ever ſuſpect an <hi>Opinion</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:29455:116"/>
that carries an <hi>Air</hi> of <hi>Novelty</hi> in it; and do always prefer a <hi>vulgar Truth</hi> before <hi>refined Error.</hi> They are <hi>vulgar Truths,</hi> which like <hi>vulgar Bleſſings,</hi> are of <hi>moſt uſe,</hi> and <hi>trueſt worth:</hi> And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our <hi>Saviour</hi> thought ſo, when he <hi>thanked his Father, that he had hid theſe things from the wiſe, and prudent, and revealed them unto Babes.</hi> And when he himſelf taught the People <hi>with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority, and not as the Scribes,</hi> he did advance no ſubtil <hi>Theories,</hi> but bright, and dazling, uſeful, and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive <hi>Truths.</hi> This minds me of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>property</hi> of <hi>Illuminating Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>Knowledge</hi> muſt not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and confuſed; but <hi>Diſtinct</hi> and <hi>Clear.</hi> Where the Images of things are ſlight, faint, and vaniſhing, they move Men but very weakly, and affect them but very coldly; eſpecially in ſuch Matters as are not ſubject to our Senſes. And this I perſwade my ſelf is one chief <hi>Reaſon, why</hi> thoſe glorious and wonderful <hi>Objects, God,</hi> a <hi>Judgment to come, Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> do ſtrike us ſo <hi>feebly,</hi> and operate ſo <hi>little.</hi> We have generally no lively, diſtinct, and

Now this ſort of <hi>Knowledge</hi> will never do the work: Theſe drouſie notices of things will never ferment, and raiſe our <hi>Paſſions</hi> for <hi>Heaven,</hi> high enough to confront and combate thoſe we have for the <hi>World.</hi> From hence we may give a fair account, what the uſe is of <hi>Prophetick Retirement,</hi> and <hi>Prophetick Eloquence:</hi> What is the purpoſe of all thoſe <hi>Schemes,</hi> and <hi>Tropes,</hi> which occur in <hi>inſpired Writings:</hi> And why the beſt of Men have ever ſo much affected <hi>Solitude,</hi> and <hi>Retreats,</hi> from the noiſe and the hurry of the World.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:29455:117"/>
they muſt be expreſſed, in <hi>moving</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in <hi>living</hi> Tropes and Figures. Ah!

This <hi>Knowledge</hi> muſt not be in the Underſtanding, <hi>crude</hi> and <hi>undige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted;</hi> but it muſt be throughly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted,</hi> and turned into <hi>Nouriſhment, Blood,</hi> and <hi>Spirits.</hi> We muſt know the true <hi>value</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of every <hi>Principle,</hi> of every <hi>Truth;</hi> and be able readily to <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> them.

if notwithſtanding I be <hi>caſt down,</hi> and <hi>broken,</hi> under every <hi>Adverſity?</hi> And thus I might go on, and ſhew you, that the <hi>Knowledge</hi> which is not digeſted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Nouriſhment</hi> is, if not a burden, of no benefit to us. 'Tis plain, <hi>that</hi> is to <hi>me</hi> nothing worth, which <hi>I</hi> make <hi>no uſe</hi> of. We muſt then follow the advice of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and never quit the Search and Meditation of <hi>Truth,</hi> till we grow <hi>intimate</hi> and <hi>familiar</hi> with it; and ſo have it always ready, for a <hi>Guide,</hi> and <hi>Guard,</hi> for our <hi>Support,</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> and for our <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> We muſt <hi>bind it about our Heart,</hi> as he ſpeaks, and <hi>tie it as an Ornament about our Neck. Then, when we go forth, it ſhall lead us, when we ſleep, it ſhall keep us, and when we awake, it ſhall talk with us: For the commandment is a Lamp, and the Law is light, and reproofs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction are the way of Life,</hi> Prov. 6. In a word, nothing can render the moſt important <hi>Truths,</hi> powerful and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in us, but ſuch a <hi>Digeſtion</hi> of them by ſerious and devout <hi>Meditation,</hi> as may in a manner <hi>incorporate</hi> them with us. And this the <hi>Scripture</hi> plainly teaches, when to ſignifie the Force and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:29455:118"/>
Vertue of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> above that of the <hi>Law,</hi> it uſes theſe words: <hi>For this is the Covenant that I will make with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Laws into their Minds, and write them in their Hearts,</hi> Heb. 8.10. intimating, that no <hi>Laws,</hi> no <hi>Principles,</hi> can ever influence us, till they be deeply <hi>imprinted</hi> in our Hearts.</p>
               <p>To <hi>wind up</hi> all. There are <hi>ſeveral</hi> kinds of <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>ſame Truths:</hi> There is a <hi>Knowledge</hi> which ſerves us, only as <hi>Piſga</hi>'s top did <hi>Moſes;</hi> to <hi>ſhew</hi> us <hi>Canaan,</hi> but not to <hi>bring us</hi> into it. There is, again, a <hi>Knowledge</hi> which ſerves us, only as the <hi>Talent</hi> did the <hi>wicked Servants;</hi> not to procure <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> but <hi>Puniſhments.</hi> And finally, there is a <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which like the <hi>Talents</hi> in the Hand of the <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>good Steward, enriches</hi> us <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends</hi> us <hi>afterwards,</hi> to <hi>higher</hi> Truſts and Dignities: which <hi>improves</hi> and <hi>perfects</hi> our <hi>Nature</hi> firſt, and then puts us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of ſuch <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> as only <hi>Nature</hi> thus <hi>improved</hi> and <hi>perfected</hi> is <hi>capable</hi> of. And this <hi>Knowledge</hi> muſt not be a ſlight, ſuperficial, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:29455:119"/>
undigeſted one; it muſt not be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and obſcure, a weak and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect one: <hi>This</hi> is <hi>not</hi> the <hi>Knowledge</hi> which will bring forth thoſe excellent <hi>Fruits,</hi> which we have reaſon to expect from true <hi>Illumination.</hi> But it muſt be a <hi>Knowledge</hi> that has all the quite <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> Characters: even ſuch as I have <hi>before</hi> deſcribed at large. That <hi>this</hi> is an <hi>Obſervation</hi> of the <hi>greateſt</hi> weight and moment, is <hi>evident</hi> to any one, who will give himſelf leave to make any <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection</hi> on the <hi>preſent</hi> State of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi> For how does the power of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> prevail, amidſt the <hi>Light</hi> of the Goſpel?

               </head>
               <p>HAving diſpatched the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Illumination</hi> in the foregoing <hi>Chapter,</hi> and ſhew'd both what <hi>Truths,</hi> and what ſort of <hi>Knowledge</hi> of them is requiſite to it; I am next to treat,
<list>
                     <item>1. Of the <hi>Fruits.</hi> And</item>
                     <item>2. Of the <hi>Attainment</hi> of it.</item>

               </p>
               <p>S. 1. As to the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I have the leſs need to inſiſt upon <hi>them,</hi> becauſe whatever can be ſaid on <hi>this</hi> Head, has been in a manner <hi>antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated:</hi> All the Characters of <hi>Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Truth</hi> and <hi>Illuminating Knowledge</hi> being ſuch as ſufficiently declare the bleſſed <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>true Illumination.</hi> I will, therefore, be very <hi>ſhort</hi> on <hi>this Head;</hi> and only juſt <hi>mention two Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages</hi> of <hi>Illumination.</hi> As the uſe of <hi>Light</hi> is eſpecially <hi>twofold,</hi> to <hi>Delight,</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:29455:120"/>
and <hi>Guide</hi> us; ſo do we reap <hi>two benefits</hi> from <hi>Illumination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>first,</hi> and moſt immediate one is, That it <hi>ſets</hi> the whole Man, and the whole Life <hi>right;</hi> that it fixes our <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> on their proper and natural <hi>Object,</hi> and directs all our <hi>Actions</hi> to their true <hi>End.</hi> I do not mean that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> conſtantly and neceſſarily <hi>influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> and <hi>determines</hi> the <hi>Will. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> tells us, that we have a <hi>fatal Liberty:</hi> That our <hi>Affections</hi> are too often <hi>independant</hi> of our <hi>Reaſon;</hi> that we <hi>ſin</hi> againſt the Dictates of <hi>Conſcience;</hi> that we purſue <hi>falſe Pleaſure,</hi> and a <hi>falſe Interest,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>True,</hi> and in plain <hi>oppoſition</hi> to our <hi>Judgment</hi> too; at leaſt to a <hi>ſedate,</hi> and <hi>calm</hi> one. And the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of all this is, becauſe we conſiſt of <hi>two</hi> different and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Principles;</hi> a <hi>Body,</hi> and a <hi>Soul:</hi> and are ſolicited by <hi>two</hi> different <hi>Worlds,</hi> a <hi>temporal,</hi> and an <hi>eternal</hi> one. But all this notwithſtanding, 'tis certain that <hi>Illumination</hi> in the Mind has a mighty Influence upon us: For it is continually exciting in us wiſe <hi>Deſires,</hi> and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>purpoſes:</hi> 'Tis always alluring and inviting us towards our Sovereign <hi>Good,</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:29455:120"/>
and reſtraining and detering us from <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death:</hi> It alarms, diſquiets, diſturbs, and perſecutes us, as often as we err and wander from the Path of Life. In one word, the great <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> is, to be always repreſenting the Beauties, and Pleaſures, and the Beatitude, and Glory, of <hi>Vertue;</hi> and remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Evils, and Diſhonours, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities, and Dangers of <hi>Vice:</hi> ſo that a Man will never be at <hi>rest,</hi> who has this <hi>Light</hi> within him, till it be either <hi>extinguiſhed</hi> or <hi>obeyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>Light</hi> within us, if it be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and complied with, not mud-died, and diſturbed; if it be not quenched, and extinguiſhed, by wilful Sin, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable Oſcitancy, and Remiſneſs; if in a word, its Influence be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, diſperſes all our <hi>Fears,</hi> as well as <hi>Errors;</hi> creates an unſpeakable <hi>Tranquility</hi> in the Soul; ſpreads over us a calm and glorious <hi>Sky;</hi> and makes every thing in us, and about us, look <hi>gay</hi> and <hi>verdant,</hi> and <hi>beautiful.</hi> The <hi>Diſſipation</hi> of <hi>Pagan Darkneſs,</hi> and all Participations, or Reſemblances of it; <hi>Deliverance</hi> from a ſtate of <hi>Bondage</hi> and <hi>Wrath;</hi> the <hi>Peace of God,</hi> the <hi>Love
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:29455:121"/>
of Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Fellowſhip of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the <hi>Immortality</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> the <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> of <hi>Eternity, good God! what</hi> ſurprizing, what raviſhing <hi>Themes</hi> are theſe, for the thoughts of an <hi>enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened</hi> Soul to dwell upon! Bleſſed and Happy is he who enjoys this <hi>Pleaſure</hi> upon Earth. And that <hi>we may,</hi> I am now to Diſcourſe</p>
               <p>S. 2. Of the <hi>Attainment</hi> of <hi>Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Now whatever advice can relate to <hi>this,</hi> may be reduced under <hi>two</hi> Heads:
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>What Qualifications</hi> do render Man <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>Illumination.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>What</hi> it is that one duly qualified is to <hi>do</hi> in <hi>Purſuit</hi> of it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. To begin with the <hi>Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> requiſite to <hi>Illumination. One</hi> Man is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>another</hi> ſeveral ways: By his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> or <hi>Fortune;</hi> by <hi>Natural,</hi> or <hi>acquired Endowments;</hi> and by <hi>Moral Diſpoſitions:</hi> and each of theſe may have ſome, though a very different, Influence upon Human <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:29455:121"/>
For if we enquire after only the <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and <hi>Integrity of Perfection;</hi> then are there <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three Moral Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,</hi> which are all that is required in order to this: But if we enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>largeneſs</hi> of its Stature, the <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry</hi> of its Features, the <hi>Luſtre</hi> of its Complexion, and the <hi>Elegance</hi> of its dreſs; then may we allow ſomething to be aſcribed to <hi>Fortune,</hi> to <hi>Nature,</hi> and a liberal <hi>Education.</hi> This is an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> very <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be made. For though <hi>every</hi> Man may be <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>Perfection,</hi> that is, <hi>Habitual Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> if it be not his own fault; yet is not <hi>every</hi> Man capable of being <hi>equally Perfect:</hi> becauſe of that accidental <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety</hi> which I have ſuggeſted; and which flows from <hi>different Gifts of God,</hi> which depend <hi>not</hi> on <hi>our ſelves.</hi> This being premiſed in order to prevent my being miſtaken, I proceed and determine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Illumination</hi> depends not upon a Man's <hi>outward Fortune.</hi> There are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>ſeveral</hi> ſorts of <hi>Knowledge</hi> which we can never arrive at without much <hi>leiſure,</hi> and much <hi>expence:</hi> And in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſupport the one, and enjoy the other, it is requiſite that we be Maſters
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:29455:122"/>
of a <hi>good Fortune.</hi> Hence is that <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> of the <hi>Author of Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> Chap. 38.24. <hi>The Wiſdom of a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man cometh by opportunity of leiſure; and he that has little buſineſs ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wiſe.</hi> And therefore in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſes, he excludes the <hi>Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> the <hi>Statuary,</hi> the <hi>Engraver,</hi> the <hi>Smith,</hi> the <hi>Potter;</hi> and all conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whoſe Time and Mind is taken up in the <hi>Labours</hi> of their <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and in making the neceſſary <hi>Proviſion</hi> for <hi>Life;</hi> theſe, I ſay, he excludes from all Pretentions to <hi>Wiſdom. How can he get Wiſdom that holdeth the Plough, and that glorieth in the Goad; whoſe talk is of Bullocks?</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>this</hi> is not the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> that I am enquiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and which conſtitutes <hi>Illumination. That</hi> conſiſts not in the Laws of our <hi>Earthly,</hi> but <hi>Heavenly</hi> Country: Not in <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> which relate to the <hi>Body</hi> and miniſter to a <hi>temporal</hi> Life; but in thoſe <hi>Divine Truths</hi> which purifie the <hi>Soul,</hi> and miniſter to an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> one: no, not in <hi>Notional Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> but in <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Vital ones.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Husbandman,</hi> and the <hi>Artiſt,</hi> the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick,</hi> and the <hi>Trader,</hi> are as capable
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:29455:122"/>
of <hi>this</hi> ſort of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as the Man of <hi>Office, Mony,</hi> or <hi>Quality.</hi> There needs no <hi>Wealth</hi> to render one <hi>the Child of Light and of the Day.</hi> There is the <hi>Book of Nature;</hi> the <hi>Book of Revelation; both</hi> the <hi>Books of God, both writ</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with glorious <hi>Illuminating</hi> Truths: <hi>Theſe</hi> lie wide <hi>open</hi> to <hi>every</hi> honeſt Chriſtian. The Being, and Nature, of God; the Mediation of Jeſus; and a Judgment to come; the Nature, and Neceſſity, of Holineſs, are fully <hi>reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and unanſwerably <hi>proved.</hi> And though <hi>every</hi> honeſt Man be not able to diſcover <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Arguments</hi> on which they ſtand, yet may he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover <hi>enough:</hi> and what is more, he may have an <hi>inward, vital, ſenſible</hi> proof of them; he may <hi>feel</hi> the <hi>Power,</hi> the <hi>Charms</hi> of <hi>Holineſs; experiment</hi> its <hi>Congruity</hi> and <hi>Lovelineſs</hi> to the <hi>Human</hi> Soul; and obſerve a thouſand Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of its <hi>ſerviceableneſs</hi> to the <hi>Honour</hi> of God, and the <hi>good</hi> of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:</hi> He may have a a full convictive ſenſe, of the <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfections,</hi> in the great work of our <hi>Redemption;</hi> and the excellent <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> of it may be ſo palpable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous to him, as to leave no room
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:29455:123"/>
for <hi>Doubts,</hi> or <hi>Scruples.</hi> But beſides all this, there is a <hi>Voice within,</hi> there is a <hi>Divine Teacher</hi> and <hi>Inſtructor,</hi> which will <hi>ever abide with him,</hi> and <hi>lead him into all neceſſary Truths:</hi> All which is implied in <hi>thoſe</hi> words of our Lord, <hi>If any Man will do his will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine; whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf,</hi> Joh. 7.17.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

                  <hi>exempt</hi> from <hi>Law,</hi> but in <hi>being a Law to our ſelves.</hi> And then I appeal to all the World, whether the Diſcipline of <hi>Vertue,</hi> or <hi>Libertiniſm;</hi> whether the Schools of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be the way to true <hi>Liberty.</hi> I appeal to the <hi>Experience</hi> of Mankind, whether <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> or <hi>Senſual,</hi> Pleaſure; whether the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> or the <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> be the more like to qualifie and diſpoſe us to obey the Dictates of ſober and ſolid <hi>Reaſon.</hi> But the Truth is here is no need of <hi>Arguments:</hi> The <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> of <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Deists</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim aloud what a glorious kind of <hi>Liberty</hi> they are like to bleſs the World with, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Whilst they promiſe Liberty, they themſelves are the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Corruption.</hi> And this <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> draws on their <hi>Ruin.</hi> The diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and miſerable <hi>Courſes,</hi> in which theſe poor Wretches are plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in which, generally, they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh before their time; are ſuch an open <hi>Contradiction</hi> to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that no Man doubts but that they have abandoned <hi>its</hi> Conduct, that they have given themſelves up to that of <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour:</hi>

And that they earneſtly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to force, or betray their <hi>Reaſon</hi> into a <hi>Compliance</hi> to <hi>Screen</hi> themſelves from the reproach and diſturbance of their own <hi>Minds,</hi> and from the ſhame and contempt of the <hi>World.</hi> I have dwelt long enough on <hi>this</hi> Argument, 'Tis <hi>now</hi> time to paſs <hi>on,</hi> and reſolve what <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> really <hi>is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is in a manner evident from what has been ſuggeſted already. For if <hi>Reaſon</hi> be the governing Faculty in <hi>Man,</hi> then the <hi>Liberty of Man</hi> muſt conſiſt in his <hi>Subjection</hi> to <hi>Reaſon:</hi> And ſo <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but <hi>Subjection</hi> to <hi>Reaſon</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd by <hi>Revelation. Two</hi> things therefore are <hi>Eſſential</hi> to true <hi>Liberty:</hi> A clear and unbiaſſed <hi>Judgment;</hi> and a Power and Capacity of Acting <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable</hi> to it. This is a very <hi>ſhort,</hi> but <hi>full</hi> Account of <hi>Liberty. Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Impotence</hi> conſtitute our <hi>Slavery: Light</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> our <hi>Freedom.</hi> Man is then <hi>free,</hi> when his <hi>Reaſon</hi> is not awed by vile <hi>Fears,</hi> or bribed by viler <hi>Hopes:</hi> When it is not tumultuoſly tranſported and hurried away by <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> nor cheated and deluded by the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:29455:137"/>
guilded appearances of <hi>Sophisticated</hi> Good; but it deliberates <hi>impartially,</hi> and commands <hi>effectually.</hi> And becauſe the great <hi>Obstacle</hi> of this <hi>Liberty</hi> is <hi>Sin;</hi> becauſe natural and contracted <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> are the <hi>Fetters</hi> in which we are bound; becauſe the <hi>Law in the Body, wars against the Law in the Mind,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuring the <hi>Light,</hi> and enfeebling the <hi>Authority,</hi> of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> hence it is, that <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> is as truly, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, deſcribed, by a <hi>Dominion</hi> over the <hi>Body,</hi> by the ſubduing our corrupt <hi>Affections,</hi> and by <hi>Deliverance</hi> from <hi>Sin.</hi> This Notion of <hi>Liberty</hi> may be ſufficiently eſtabliſhed upon that Account of <hi>Servitude</hi> or <hi>Bondage</hi> which the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. where he repreſents it as conſiſting in <hi>Impotence,</hi> or <hi>Inability</hi> to do thoſe things, which <hi>God</hi> commands, and <hi>Reaſon</hi> approves: <hi>for to will is preſent with me; but how to perform that which is good, I find not,</hi> ver. 18. <hi>Liberty,</hi> therefore, muſt on the <hi>contrary</hi> conſiſt, in being <hi>able,</hi> not only to <hi>will,</hi> but to <hi>do</hi> good; in <hi>obeying</hi> thoſe <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which we cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>good.</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:29455:138"/>
And this is the very Notion which our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master</hi> gives us of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. For, when the <hi>Jews</hi> bragg'd of their <hi>Freedom,</hi> he lets them know, that <hi>Freedom</hi> could not conſiſt with <hi>Subjection</hi> to <hi>Sin: he that committeth Sin is the Servant of Sin,</hi> ver. 34. That honourable <hi>Parentage,</hi> and the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> was but a falſe and ludicrous <hi>Appearance</hi> of <hi>Liberty:</hi> that if they would be <hi>free indeed, the Son must make them ſo,</hi> ver. 36. <hi>i. e.</hi> they muſt, by his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> be reſcued from the <hi>Servitude</hi> of <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>Errour,</hi> and be ſet at <hi>Liberty</hi> to work <hi>Righteouſneſs. If ye continue in my word, then are ye my Diſciples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: and ye ſhall know the Truth, and the Truth ſhall make you free,</hi> ver. 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 32. Finally, not to multiply <hi>Proofs,</hi> of a truth that is ſcarce liable to be <hi>controverted,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> deſcribes the <hi>Bondage</hi> of a <hi>Sinner</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. ſo does he the <hi>Liberty</hi> of a <hi>Saint</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. For there, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. he tells us, That <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life</hi> has ſet the true Chriſtian <hi>free from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi> And then he lets us know, <hi>wherein</hi> this <hi>Liberty</hi> conſiſts;

If Chriſt be in you, the Body is dead becauſe of Sin, but the Spirit is Life becauſe of Righteouſneſs,</hi> ver. 10. And all this is the ſame thing with his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription</hi> of <hi>Liberty, Chapter</hi> 6. where, 'tis nothing elſe, but for a Man to be made <hi>free from Sin, and become the Servant of God.</hi> Thus then we have a plain account of <hi>Bondage</hi> and <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Yet for the clearer underſtanding of <hi>both,</hi> it will not be amiſs to obſerve, that they are <hi>each</hi> capable of different <hi>Degrees;</hi> and both the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> may be <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi> entire, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and abſolute, according to the different <hi>Progreſs</hi> of Men in <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> Thus, in <hi>ſome</hi> Men, not their <hi>Will</hi> only, but their very <hi>Reaſon</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved.

if the <hi>World be as much crucified to him, as he to it;</hi> I cannot ſee why it ſhould not be <hi>eaſie</hi> for him to act <hi>conſonant</hi> to his <hi>Nature:</hi> why he ſhould not with Pleaſure and Readineſs <hi>follow</hi> that <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> thoſe <hi>Affections,</hi> which <hi>reign</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> in him.

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Liberty as it relates to Original Sin.</head>
               <p>WHatever Difficulties the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Original Sin really be involved in, or ſeem at leaſt to ſome to be ſo, they will not concern me, who am no further obliged to conſider it, than as it is an Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Perfection: For though there be much Diſputes about Original Sin, there is little or none about Original <hi>Corruption;</hi> the <hi>Reality</hi> of this is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acknowledged, though the <hi>Guilt,</hi> the Sinfulneſs or Immorality of it, be controverted. And though there be
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:29455:174"/>
Diverſity of Opinions concerning the Effects of Original <hi>Corruption</hi> in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet there is no Doubt at all made but that it incites and inſtigates us to actual Sin; and is the Seed-plot of Human Folly, and Wickedneſs. All Men I think, are agreed, that there is a Byaſs and ſtrong Propenſion in our Nature towards the Things of the World, and the Body; That the ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of the Body to the Soul, and of the Soul to God, wherein conſiſts Righteouſneſs, is ſubverted and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown: That we have Appetites which claſh with, and oppoſe the Commands of God, not only when they threaten Violence to our Nature, as in the Caſes of Confeſſion and Martyrdom, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo when they only prune its Luxurian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Extravagance: That we do not only deſire ſenſitive Pleaſure, but even to that Degree, that it hurries, and tranſports us, beyond the Bounds, that Reaſon and Religion ſet us: We have not only an Averſion for Pain and Toil and Death, but to that Exceſs, that it tempts us to renounce God, and our Duty for the ſake of Carnal Eaſe, and Temporal ſafety. And finally, that we
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:29455:174"/>
are ſo backward to entertain the Belief of revealed Truths, ſo prone to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate our Thoughts on, and confine our Deſires within this viſible World as our Portion, and to look upon our ſelves, no other than the mortal, and corruptible Inhabitants of it; that this makes us ſelfiſh, and ſordid, proud and ambitious, falſe, ſubtle, and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the endleſs Diſturbance of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and our ſelves. That this I ſay, is the ſtate of Nature, that this is the Corruption we Labour under, all Men, I think, are agreed: And no wonder; for did a Controverſie ariſe about this, there would be no need to appeal any further, for the Deciſion of it, than to ones own Experience; this would tell every one that thus it is in Fact; and Reaſon, if we will conſult it, will tell us, why it is ſo: for what other than this, can be the Condition of Man, who enters the World with a Soul ſo dark and deſtitute of Divine Light, ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly immerced and plung'd into Fleſh and Blood, ſo tenderly and intimately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by Bodily Senſations; and with a Body, ſo adapted and ſuited to the Things of this World, and faſtened to
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:29455:175"/>
it by the Charms of Pleaſure, and the Bonds of Intereſt, Convenience and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. This Account of Original Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, agrees very well with <hi>that</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: And with that Aſſertion of our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter,</hi> on which he builds the neceſſity of <hi>Regeneration</hi> by <hi>Water</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> Joh. 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh, and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Having thus briefly explained, what I mean in this Chapter by <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin,</hi> I am next to conſider theſe two Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How far this Diſtemper of Nature is curable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Which way this Cure is to be effected.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt Enquiry, I would not be underſtood to proceed in it with a regard to all the <hi>Regenerate</hi> in General, but only to the <hi>Perfect;</hi> for the ſtrength of Original Sin cannot but be very different in new Converts, or Babes in Grace, and in ſuch as are advanced to an Habit of Righteouſneſs. This being
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:29455:175"/>
premiſed, I think, I may on good Ground reſolve. That Original Sin in the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man, may be ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and maſter'd, as to give him but very <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>ſlight</hi> Diſturbance. This ſeems to me evident from the great Change, that muſt be wrought in him, who is converted from a Sinner into a Saint; <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature: old things are past away, behold all things are become new,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. and it is hard to conceive this new Nature, without new Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Inclinations, not only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from, but repugnant to, our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Original and Corrupt ones; or at leaſt we muſt ſuppoſe this new Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo far to have reformed and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the Man, that Original Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has loſt the Strength and Force, which before it had. This will be more clear yet, if we obſerve never ſo ſlightly, the ſeveral Parts of this great Change. Firſt, the Soul of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Perſon is filled with an unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and habitual Sorrow for, and Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of, all Sin; <hi>I hate,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, every falſe way.</hi> And how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent is the ſtrength, and Heat of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:29455:176"/>
corrupt Propenſions, with the Tears and Averſions of a true Penitent? how tame is the Body, how pure the Mind, when the Man is poſſeſs'd with a firm and holy Indignation againſt Sin, when he diſſolves in the pious Tenderneſs of a contrite Spirit! Next the Soul of a good Man, is poſſeſſed with an ardent Love of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> with a firm Belief, and a ſteady Hope of a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Eternity; with enlightened Eyes he beholds the Vanity of all earthly Things, and admires the Solidity, the Weight, and Duration of Heavenly Glory: <hi>he is riſen with Christ,</hi> and therefore <hi>ſeeks thoſe things that are above where Chriſt ſits on the right hand of God: He has ſet his Affection on things above, and not on things on the Earth; for he is dead, and his Life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> And muſt we not now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch a one cleanſed and purified from all corrupt Affections, when the very Bent of his Soul is quite another way? muſt we not ſuppoſe the Force and Strength of depraved Nature, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred and ſubdued, by theſe heavenly Affections? How mortified muſt ſuch a Man be to the World and to the Body?
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:29455:176"/>
how feeble is the Oppoſition, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Nature can raiſe againſt a Mind, inveſted with ſo abſolute and ſoveraign Authority, and endowed with Light and Strength from above? Laſtly, the Perfect Man has not only crucified the Inordinate and ſinful Luſts and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Body, but has alſo obtained a great Maſtery even over the <hi>natural Appetites</hi> of it; how elſe can it be that his <hi>Deſires,</hi> and <hi>Hopes,</hi> are in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> that he <hi>waits for the Lord from thence;</hi> that he deſires to be <hi>diſſolved</hi> and <hi>to be with Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>groans</hi> to <hi>be rid</hi> of the <hi>corruptible Tabernacle</hi> of the <hi>Body?</hi> He that is thus above the <hi>Body,</hi> may certainly be concluded, to be in ſome degree above, even the moſt <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Appetites.</hi> He that has ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf free in a great Meaſure, even from his Averſion to Death, and in his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection at leaſt very much looſen'd the bond, the knot, that unties Soul and Body, may certainly very reaſonably be preſumed to be much more above all covetous, ambitious, or wanton Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Theſe are the Grounds on which I attribute to the Perfect Man, ſo high a Degree of Freedom from Original
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:29455:177"/>
Sin as I do in the Propoſition laid down.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. But yet I do not in the leaſt think, that the moſt Perfect Man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, can ſo extinguiſh the ſparks of Original Corruption, but that if he do not keep a Watch and Guard upon himſelf, they will gather Strength and revive again: And the Reaſon of this is plain; becauſe it has a Foundation in our very Nature. The Diſpute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Exiſtence of Original Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in us after Baptiſm, or Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is, methinks a very needleſs one: For if it be about the Notion we ought to entertain of it, that is, whether it be properly Sin or not, this is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention about Words; for what ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it by what Name we call this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of Original Pravity, when all grant, that the Stain and Guilt of it, is waſhed off and pardoned: But if it be about the Force and Efficacy of it, this indeed is a Controverſie of ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but a very fooliſh one, on one ſide: for to what purpoſe can it be, to ſay a great many ſubtil and puzling Things againſt a Truth, that every Man feels and experiments at one time or other. Upon the whole then, I may
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:29455:177"/>
thus deſcribe the Liberty of the Perfect Man with reſpect to Original Sin: He has <hi>mortified</hi> it, though not utterly <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated</hi> it, he has <hi>ſubdued</hi> it though not <hi>exterminated</hi> it; and therefore he is not only free from ſinful and inordinate Luſts and Affections, but alſo, in a far greater meaſure than other Men, from thoſe Infirmities and Irregularities which are, as it were, the ſtruglings and Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions of Original Sin, not yet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently tam'd. He has advanced his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory very far, even over his natural Appetites; he has no ſtronger Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Body, or for the World, and the Things of it, than ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Man that is poſſeſſed with a deep ſenſe of the Vanity of this World, and the Bleſſedneſs of another. The World is in a high Degree crucified to him, and he counts all things but dung and droſs in compariſon with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord. His Sorrows and his Joys, his Deſires and his Fears, be the occaſion never ſo juſt or lawful, paſs not the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Bounds of a wiſe Moderation. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires without Impatience, cares and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives, hopes and purſues, without Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, or Sollicitude; he is cautious without
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:29455:178"/>
Fear and Puſillanimity, he is ſad without Dejection or Deſpondency, and Pleaſant without Vanity. All this indeed ſhews him, not only to have conquered Sin and Folly, but in a great Meaſure alſo, his natural Propenſion to them. But after all, this happy Creature muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he is ſtill in the Body, in the Body whoſe Appetites will ſoon paſs beyond their due Bounds, if he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent or careleſs: he muſt remember that he is not immutably holy, his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is not ſo clear and bright, but that it may be deceived, nor the Bent of his Affections ſo ſtrongly ſet upon good, but that they may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; and therefore he muſt be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and vigilant, and fear always. Thus have I ſtated the Cureableneſs of our Original Corruption. And as I think, I have plainly the Countenance of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo I do not ſee, that I in the leaſt claſh with that Clauſe, in the Ninth Article of our Church, which affirms concerning Original Sin thus. <hi>And this Infection of Nature doth remain, yea, in them that are regenerated, whereby the Lust of the Fleſh, called in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which ſome do expound the Wiſdom, ſome ſenſuality, ſome the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:29455:178"/>
Affection, ſome the Deſire of the Fleſh, is not ſubject to the Law of God.</hi> For this muſt not be underſtood ſurely, as if the Fleſh did always Luſt againſt the Spirit in the Regenerate, but only that the Regenerate themſelves are liable and obnoxious to theſe Luſtings; which, on ſuppoſal, that the Perfect Man were here thought upon by the Compilers of this Article, imports no Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to any thing I have delivered. The Truth is, I have aſſerted no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Cureableneſs of Original Corruption, than what is neceſſary to ſecure the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as well as the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> I have too often had occaſion to obſerve, that the ſtating our Obligation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Original Corruption too laxly, miniſters not a little to the Carnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of ſupine and careleſs Perſons. How greedily do ſome imbibe, and how fond are they of this Notion, that the Fleſh, even in the Regenerate, does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Luſt againſt the Spirit? and the next thing is, to look upon their dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Errors, as unavoidable Infirmities, flowing from the uncurable Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Original Sin. To the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:29455:179"/>
that under Colour and Pretence of the Impoſſibility of a perfect Cure and Reſtitution of our Nature to perfect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and unſpotted Purity, we may not ſit down contented in an impure State; and never advance to thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Health and Innocence, which we may, and ought actually arrive at, I think fit here, to guard the Doctrine of Original Sin, with this one general Caution.</p>
               <p>That we be very careful not to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake Contracted for Natural Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; not to miſtake a Super-induced Nature, defaced by all the Slime and Mud, which popular Errors and Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons leave upon it, for Original Nature, or Nature in that State in which it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the World. 'Tis I doubt, a very hard thing to find, but one arrived at any Maturity of Years, in whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the ſame thing now, that it was in the Womb or the Cradle; in whom theſe are no worſe Propenſions, than what neceſſarily flow from the Frame and Compoſition of his Being. Alas! our Original Depravation, be it what it will, is very betimes improved by falſe Principles and fooliſh Cuſtoms;
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:29455:179"/>
by a careleſs Education, and by the Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhments and Inſinuations of the World: and every Man is ſo partial to himſelf, that he is very willing to have his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Errors paſs under the Name of Natural and unavoidable ones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this ſeems to carry in it its own Apology. This is a fatal Error and continues Men in their Vices, nay gives them peace in them too, to their Lives End; for why ſhould not a Man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear attempting what he deſpairs of effecting? To prevent which, I earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire my Reader to conſider, that all, who have treated this Doctrine of Original Sin with any Solidity or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, do carry the Matter as far at leaſt, as I have done: They teach not only that Original Corruption may be <hi>Prun'd</hi> and <hi>Lop't,</hi> but that it may be <hi>cut down, mortified,</hi> and <hi>dried up.</hi> That ſince no Man can aſſure himſelf how far he may advance his Conqueſt over his natural Corruption, and the Intereſt of every Man's ſafety and Glory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges him to advance it as far as he can, he muſt never ceaſe fighting againſt it, while it fights againſt him. That ſince every Sin is ſo far Mortal as it is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:29455:180"/>
and has as much Guilt in it as Freedom, every Man ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly jealous, leaſt he be ſubject to any vicious Inclination, that is in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the Pruduct not of Nature, but of Choice. And Laſtly, ſince though much leſs than habitual Goodneſs may conſtitute a Man in a State of Grace, yet nothing leſs can produce Perfection, or a conſtant Aſſurance of Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: therefore no Man ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce, while he ſees himſelf ſhort of this: and every Man ſhould remember that his Goodneſs ought to conſiſt in a Habit of thoſe Vertues, to which, he is by Nature the moſt averſe. I have now diſpatched My firſt Enquiry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved how far Original Sin is curable. The Next is,</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. How this Cure may be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And here 'tis plain, what we are to aim at in general; for if Original Righteouſneſs conſiſts, as I think it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted in the Subordination of the Body to the Soul, and the Soul to God; and Original Corruption in the Subverſion of this Order, then the Cure muſt conſiſt in reſtoring this Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:29455:180"/>
by the weakning and reducing the Power of the Body, and by quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſtrengthening the Mind, and ſo re-eſtabliſhing its Soveraignty and Authority. The Scriptures according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let us know, that this is the great Deſign of Religion, and the great Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9, 25. <hi>And eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man that ſtriveth for the Maſtery, is temperate in all things. Now they do it to, obtain a corruptible Crown, but we an incorruptible.</hi> And this St. <hi>Paul</hi> illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and explains by his own exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the following Words. <hi>I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo run, not as uncertainly: ſo fight I, not as one that beateth the Air: But I keep under my Body, and bring it into Subjection.</hi> The Preference, given to the Cares and Appetites of the Body or of the Mind, is the diſtinguiſhing Character which conſtitutes and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Man either Holy or Wicked, <hi>they that are of the fleſh do mind the things of the fleſh, and they that are of the Spirit the things of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.5. And the Threats of the Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Servants of the Fleſh, its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to the Servants of the Spirit; <hi>For if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye: but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:29455:181"/>
the deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live,</hi> Rom. 8.13. <hi>He that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption: but he that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap life everlaſting,</hi> Gal. 6.8. I grant that in theſe Places, and elſewhere very commonly, as by the Spirit is meant the Mind enlightened and aided by the Grace of God, ſo by the Body or Fleſh is meant our inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Nature, not juſt ſuch as it proceeds out of the Womb, but as it is further depraved by a Carnal and Worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. However ſince <hi>Original</hi> is the Seed, or Root of <hi>Voluntary</hi> or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary Corruption, theſe Texts do properly and directly enough, ſerve to the Confirmation of the Doctrine for which they are alledg'd. This then is the great Duty of Man, this is the great End which he is always to have in his Eye, the mortifying the Body, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſubjugating it to the Reaſon of the Mind. Here the Chriſtian Warfare muſt begin, and here end; for he who has crucified the Body with the Luſts and Affections thereof, has entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reſt, as far as this Life is capable of it: He that laies the Foundation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:29455:181"/>
here, does build upon a Rock, and he that here puſhes his Succeſs to the utmoſt point, has reached the higheſt Round in the Scale of Perfection, and given the finiſhing ſtrokes to Holineſs and Vertue. This I ſay then, he that will be free, muſt lay down as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule to himſelf, from which he muſt reſolve never to ſwerve; That he is by all rational and poſſible Methods to diminiſh the Strength and Authority of the Body, and increaſe that of the Mind. By this we ought to judge of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences or Inconveniences of our worldly Fortunes; by this we are to determine of the Innocence or Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Actions; by this we are to form and eſtimate our Acquaintance and Converſation, and by this we are to judge of the Bent and Tendency of our Lives; by this we are to regulate our Diverſions; by this we may reſolve of the Nature and Degree of our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, whether lawful, whether expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or not: And in one word, by this we may paſs a true Sentence upon the Degrees and Meaſures of our Natural Affections. There are many things, that are in their own Nature indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:29455:182"/>
enough that prove not ſo to me; and there is ſuch a Latitude in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and Meaſures of Duty and Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations from it, that it is a very hard matter in ſeveral Caſes, to define nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtrictly what is lawful or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. But I am ſure in all Caſes this is a wiſe and ſafe Rule that we are to aim at the ſtrengthning the Authority of our Minds, and the weakning the Force and Power of our carnal Appetites. By Conſequence every Man ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himſelf, by what Arts, by what Practiſes the Light of his Underſtanding comes to be obſcured, the Authority of his Reaſon weaken'd, and the Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Conſcience to be ſo much blunted and worn off. And when he has diſcovered this, he muſt avoid theſe things as temptations and ſnares; he muſt ſhun theſe Paths as thoſe that lead to Danger and Death; and whatever he finds to have a contrary Tendency, theſe are the things that he muſt do, theſe are the things that he muſt Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy contrive, and follow, how happy would a Man be, how perfect would he ſoon grow, if he did conduct himſelf by this Rule? how little need would he
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:29455:182"/>
have of outward Comforts; how little value would he have for Power and Honour, for the State and Pride of Life? how little would he hunt after the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Senſe; what Peace ſhould he maintain within, when he ſhould do nothing that were repugnant to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Mind; what Joy and Hope would he abound with, when he ſhould have ſo many daily Proofs of his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, as the living above the Body would give him? and how would all this ſtrengthen and exalt the Mind; what Flights would it take towards Heaven, and how invincible would it prove to all Temptations? Happy and Perfect that Man, who has the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God thus within him, whoſe Life is hid with Chriſt in God, when Chriſt who is his Life ſhall appear, he alſo ſhall appear with him in Glory! This is a comprehenſive Rule, and, if well purſued, ſufficient of its ſelf to do the Work I am here aiming at: But that it may be more eaſily reduced to Practice, I think it not amiſs, to take a more particular View of it; And then it may be reſolved into theſe two.</p>

                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:29455:183"/>1. We muſt lay due Reſtraints up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt invigorate and fortifie the Mind, partly by the Light of the Goſpel, and the Grace of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and partly by accuſtoming it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and with draw it ſelf from the Body.</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. As to the Reſtraints we are to lay upon the Body, what they are, we eaſily learn from the Scriptures; for Firſt, theſe expreſly forbid us to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Luſts and Affections of the Fleſh, and that not only becauſe they are injurious to our Neighbour, and a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to our holy Profeſſion, but alſo becauſe they have an ill Influence upon the ſtrength and Liberty, the Power and Authority of the Mind; <hi>Dearly beloved I beſeech you as Strangers and Pilgrims abſtain from fleſhly Luſts which war against the Soul,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11. And whoever enters into the account of things, will eaſily diſcern this to be true; there is a Deceitfulneſs in Sin, a ſenſuality in Luſt; Who ſees not that there is more Attraction in the Pride,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:29455:183"/>
and Oſtentation of Life, than in the Simplicity and Plainneſs of it. That there is more Temptation, and Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Riot and Luxury, than in frugality and a Competency? that the Imagination of a <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf cannot but be wretchedly abuſed, if he give it leave to wander and wanton in variety? In a word, if the Mind follow a carnal or worldly Appetite and Fancy in all its Exceſſes and Debauches, it will ſoon find it ſelf miſerably enſlaved and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated; it will be wholly in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Body, and wholly given up to to the Pleaſures of it. Secondly, Though the Scripture do not prohibit ſome <hi>States</hi> or <hi>Conditions</hi> of this Life, which ſeem as it were more nearly <hi>allied</hi> to, or at leaſt-wiſe at leſs Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the <hi>Luſts of the Fleſh</hi> than others are, yet it forbids us to <hi>covet</hi> and <hi>purſue</hi> them. Thus St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Mind not high things.</hi> The Apoſtle does not here oblige any Man to degrade himſelf beneath his Birth, or to fly from thoſe Advantages, which God's Providence and his own Merits give him a juſt Title to; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he does oblige the Chriſtian not
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:29455:184"/>
to aſpire ambitiouſly to great Things, nor fondly to pride himſelf in ſucceſſes of this kind: ſo when a little after he commands us in Honour to prefer one another, certainly he does not teach how to talk, but how to act, not how to court and compliment, but how to deport our ſelves conſonant to thoſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with which Charity towards our Neighbour and Humility towards our ſelves ought to inſpire us. Thus again we are not forbidden to be rich; no Man is bound to ſtrip himſelf of thoſe Poſſeſſions which he is born to, or to ſhut out that Increaſe, which God's Bleſſing, and his own Diligence natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bring in. But we are forbid to <hi>thirſt after Riches,</hi> or to <hi>value</hi> our ſelves upon them, and commanded to be content with thoſe things that we have; and if God bleſs us with Wealth to enjoy it with Modeſty and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and diſpenſe it with Liberality, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Godlineſs with Contentment is great gain: for we brought nothing into this World, and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain we can carry nothing out, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Food and Raiment, let us be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with content. But they that will be rich,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:29455:184"/>
fall into temptation, and a Snare, and into many fooliſh, and hurtful Luſts, which drown Men in Deſtruction and Perdition. For the Love of Money is the root of all Evil, which while ſome coveted after they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves thorow with many Sorrows.</hi> ver. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this World, that they be not high minded, nor truſt in uncertain Riches, but in the living God, who giveth us all things richly to enjoy. That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute; willing to communicate. Laying up in store for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on Eternal Life.</hi> And to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply no more Inſtances of Reſtraints of this or the like nature, thus we ought to ſtand affected towards <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Reputation, Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Power, Beauty, Strength,</hi> &amp;c. We muſt neither be too Intent upon them, nor enjoy them with too much Guſt and Satisfaction; for this is that Diſpoſition which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me to ſuit beſt with the Spirit and Deſign of the Goſpel, and with the Nature of ſuch things as being of a
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:29455:185"/>
middle ſort, are equally capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either Temptations or Bleſſings, Inſtruments of Good or Evil.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. The Scripture regulates and bounds our <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, not ſo much by <hi>nicely</hi> defining the <hi>exact</hi> Degrees and Meaſures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which Nature muſt be ſtrictly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as by exalted <hi>Examples,</hi> of, and <hi>Exhortations</hi> to, a <hi>Spiritual, pure</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> Diſpoſition. Thus our Lord and Maſter ſeems to me, to give ſome check to the ſtream of natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to call off his Diſciples from it to the Conſideration of a Spiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>Mark</hi> 3.34, 35. <hi>And he looked round about on them which ſate about him, and ſaid, behold my Mother and my Brethren. For whoſoever ſhall do the will of God, the ſame is my Brother, and my Siſter, and Mother.</hi> To which words of our Lord I may joyn thoſe of St. <hi>Paul, henceforth know we no Man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him no more,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. The Anſwer of our Lord to a Diſciple, who would have deferr'd his following him till he had Buried his Father, <hi>Matt.</hi> 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1. and to him who begged leave to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:29455:185"/>
go and bid farewell, firſt to his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Domeſticks, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.61. does plainly countenance the Doctrine I here advance; and ſo does St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29. ſo often cited by me. Not that our Saviour or his Apoſtles did ever account our natural Affections <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure;</hi> for 'tis a Vice to be without them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. not that they went about to diminiſh, or abate, much leſs to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel the <hi>Duties</hi> flowing from them, no; They only prune the <hi>Luxuriancy</hi> of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught</hi> Nature, and correct the <hi>Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> and <hi>Infirmities</hi> of <hi>Animal</hi> Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Our natural Affections may entangle and enſlave us, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and irregular ones, if we lay no Reſtraint upon them. Religion indeed, makes them the Seeds of Vertue; but without it, they eaſily betray us into Sin and Folly. For this Reaſon I doubt not, leſt, under pretence of ſatisfying our moſt natural and importunate Appetites, we ſhould be enſnared into the Love of this World, and intangled in the Cares of it, our Saviour forbids us to take thought for to morrow, even for the <hi>neceſſaries</hi> of to morrow, <hi>what we ſhall eat, and what we ſhall drink, and where-withal
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:29455:186"/>
we ſhall be clothed, Matt.</hi> 6. Theſe are the Reſtraints laid upon the Body in Scripture, which if any Man obſerve, he will ſoon diſcern himſelf as far puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and freed from Original Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Human Nature in this Life is capable of. And that he may,</p>
               <p n="1">§. 2ly. He muſt fortifie and invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Mind. And this muſt be done two ways, Firſt, by poſſeſſing it with the Knowledge of the Goſpel and the Grace of the Spirit. Secondly by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing it often from the Body. As to the former Branch of this Rule, the Neceſſity of it is apparent; ſince the ſtate of Nature is ſuch, as has before been deſcribed, we ſtand in need, not only of <hi>Revelation</hi> to <hi>enlighten</hi> us, but alſo of <hi>Grace</hi> to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> us; Of the former to excite us to exert all the Force and Power we have; of the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to enable us to do that which our natural Force never can effect. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be here expected, that I ſhould treat of the Operation of the Spirit, and the Ways of obtaining it, grieving, and quenching it: this would demand a peculiar Treatiſe. I will here only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:29455:186"/>
That 'tis the Work of the Spirit to <hi>repair,</hi> in ſome Degree at leaſt, the <hi>Ruins</hi> of the <hi>Fall;</hi> to <hi>rectifie Nature;</hi> to <hi>improve</hi> our <hi>Faculties,</hi> and to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print</hi> in us the <hi>Divine Image:</hi> That Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and Prayer, and a careful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Divine Will, obtain and increaſe the Grace of the Spirit; That Negligence and preſumptuous Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs grieve and extinguiſh it. As to the Knowledge of the Goſpel, I ſhall not need to ſay much here; I have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this matter in the Chapter of Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; and will only obſerve that the Doctrines of the Goſpel are ſuch, as if they be thoroughly imbibed, do effectually raiſe us above a ſtate of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and ſet us free from the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Prevalence</hi> of our Original Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Were we but once perſwaded that we are Strangers and Pilgrims up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, That all Carnal Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations do war againſt the Soul, That our Souls are properly our ſelves, and That our firſt Cares are to be for them; That God is himſelf our Sovereign Good, and the Fountain of all inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Good; that our Perfection and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conſiſt in the Love and Service of
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:29455:187"/>
Him; That we have a mighty Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour who once Died for us, and ever Lives to make Interceſſion for us; That a Kingdom, incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, is reſerved in Heaven, for all meek, faithful, and holy Souls: Were we, I ſay, but once thoroughly perſwaded of theſe Truths, with what Vigour would they impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate our Minds? how clear would be the Convictions of Conſcience; how uncontroulable the Authority of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; how ſtrong the Inſtincts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions of the Mind towards Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Vertue? Theſe would alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Mind from the World and the Body, and turn the Bent of it another way; theſe would inſpire it with other Deſires and Hopes, and make it form different Projects from what it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; <hi>old things are done away, and all things are become new.</hi> The Second Branch, of this ſecond particular Rule is, that we muſt accuſtom our ſelves to retire frequently from the Commerce and Converſation of the Body. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Eating the forbidden Fruit did open to the Mind new Scenes of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, which it thought not of, and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:29455:187"/>
ſo called it down, from the Serenity and Heights of a more pure and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Life, to participate the turbulent Pleaſures of Senſe, immerſing it as it were by this means deeper into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I pretend not to judge. But 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, a too too intimate Conjunction of the Mind with the Body and the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of it, does very much debaſe it. 'Tis our great Unhappineſs that the Soul is always in the Senſes, and the Senſes are always upon the World; we converſe with the World; we talk of the World; we think of the World; we project for the World; and what can this produce, but a carnal and worldly Frame of Spirit? We muſt meditate Heavenly Things; we muſt have our Converſation in Heaven; we muſt accuſtom our ſelves to inward and Heavenly Pleaſures, if we will have Heavenly Minds: We muſt let no day paſs, wherein we muſt not withdraw our ſelves from the Body, and ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter our ſelves from the World, that we may converſe with God and our own Souls. This will ſoon enable us to diſdain the low and beggerly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of the outward Man, and make
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:29455:188"/>
us long to be ſet free from the Weight of this corruptible Body, to breath in purer Air, and take our fill of refined and ſpiritual Pleaſure. I have inſiſted thus long on the Cure of Original Sin, not only becauſe it is the <hi>Root</hi> of all our <hi>Miſery,</hi> but alſo, becauſe there is ſuch an <hi>Affinity</hi> between this and the Sin of Infirmity, which I am next to ſpeak to, that the ſame Remedies may be preſcribed to both: ſo that I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready eaſed of a part of the Labour which I muſt otherwiſe have under-gone in the following Chapter.</p>
               <p>I am now, by the Laws of my own Method, obliged to conſider the <hi>Effects</hi> of this Branch of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> in the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man; and to ſhew what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence it has upon his Happineſs. But having, <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. diſcourſed at large of the Subſerviency of Perfection to our Happineſs; and in <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. of the happy Effects of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Liberty in general, I have the leſs need to ſay much here on this Head: Yet I cannot wholly forbear ſaying ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it. The Conqueſt over Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Corruption, ſuch as I have deſcribed it, raiſes Man to the higheſt pitch of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:29455:188"/>
Perfection that our Nature is capable of; makes him approach the neareſt, that Mortality can, to the Life of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and plants him on the Mount of God, where Grace, and Joy, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhines always on him with more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and ſtrong Raies. Now is Virtue <hi>truly Lovely,</hi> and <hi>truly Happy;</hi> now the Aſſurance of the Mind is never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, its Joy never over caſt; It enjoys a perpetual Calm within, and ſparkles with a peculiar Luſtre that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be counterfeited, cannot be equall'd. Some faint and partial Reſemblances, I confeſs, of this Vertue, or rather of this State or Conſummation of it, have I, though very rarely, ſeen in ſome maſterly ſtrokes of Nature. I have obſerved in ſome that ſweetneſs of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in others that Coldneſs and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Command over themſelves with reſpect to the Pleaſures, and in ſeveral that innate Modeſty and Humility, that natural Indifference for the Power, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Grandure of Life, that I could ſcarce forbear pronouncing that they had ſo far each of them eſcaped the <hi>Contagion</hi> of Original Corruption, and could not but bleſs and love them. But
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:29455:189"/>
after all, there is a vaſt Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe <hi>Creatures</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Grace;</hi> the Perfection of the one is confined to this or that particular Diſpoſition, but that of the other is in its Degree Univerſal; The Perfection of the one has indeed as much Charm in it as pure Nature can have; but the other has a Mixture of ſomething Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in it, it has an Heavenly Tincture which add ſomething of <hi>Sacredneſs</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> to it that Nature wants; The Perfection of the one is indeed ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to its ſelf, and amiable to others, but the Perfection of the other is Joy and Glory within, and commands a Veneration as well as Love from all it converſes with. Bleſſed State! when ſhall I attain thy lovely Innocence! when ſhall I enter into thy Divine Reſt! when ſhall I arrive at thy Security, thy Pleaſure!</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of Liberty with reſpect to Sins of Infirmity.</head>
               <p>THis is a <hi>Subject,</hi> wherein the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Being</hi> of Holineſs or Vertue, the <hi>Salvation</hi> of Man, and the <hi>Honour</hi> of God, are deeply intereſſed: For if we allow of ſuch Sins for <hi>Venial,</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are not ſo, we deſtroy the Notion, or evacuate the Neceſſity of Holineſs; endanger the Salvation of Man, and bring a Reflection upon God as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of Impiety. On the other hand, if we aſſert thoſe Sins <hi>damnable,</hi> which are not really ſo, we miſerably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex and diſturb the <hi>Minds</hi> of Men, and are highly injurious to the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of God; repreſenting Him as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and intolerable Maſter. But how important ſoever this Subject be, there is no other, I think, in the compaſs of Divinity, wherein ſo many Writers have been ſo unfortunately engaged; ſo that it is over-grown with Diſpute and Controverſie, with Confuſion and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:29455:190"/>
Obſcurity, and numberleſs Abſurdities and Contradictions. This I have thought neceſſary to obſerve in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of my Diſcourſe, not to inſult the Performances of others, or to raiſe in the Reader any great Expectation for my own; but indeed for a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Reaſon, namely, to diſpoſe him to a favourable Reception of what I here offer towards the rendring the Doctrine of Sins of Infirmity intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, and preventing the Diſſervice which Miſtakes about it do to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>By Sins of Infirmity, both <hi>Ancients</hi> and <hi>Moderns, Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> do I think, underſtand ſuch Sins as are conſiſtent with a State of Grace and Favour; from which the beſt Men are never entirely freed in this Life, though they be not imputed to them. This then being taken for granted, I ſhall Enquire into theſe three Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether there be any ſuch Sins, Sins in which the moſt Perfect live and dye.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If there are, what theſe be. What it is that diſtinguiſhes them from <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> or <hi>Mortal</hi> ones.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:29455:190"/>3. How far we are to extend the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> of the Perfect Man in Relation to <hi>theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether there be any ſuch. That the beſt Men are not without Errors, without Defects and Failings, and that not only in their paſt Life or unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate State, but their beſt and moſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect one, is a Truth which cannot, one would think, be controverted: For what <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> is there which is not liable to <hi>Error?</hi> what <hi>Will</hi> that does not feel ſomething of <hi>Impotence,</hi> ſomething of <hi>Irregularity?</hi> What <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> that are meerly Human, are ever <hi>constant,</hi> ever <hi>raiſed?</hi> Where is the <hi>Faith</hi> that has no <hi>Scruple,</hi> no <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> the <hi>Love</hi> that has no <hi>Defect,</hi> no <hi>Remiſſion;</hi> the <hi>Hope</hi> that has no <hi>Fear</hi> in it? what is the <hi>State</hi> which is not liable to <hi>Ignorance, Inadvertency, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, Infirmity?</hi> where is the <hi>Obedience</hi> that has no <hi>Reluctancy,</hi> no <hi>Remiſneſs,</hi> no <hi>Deviation?</hi> This is a Truth which, whether Men will or no, they cannot chuſe but feel; the Confeſſions of the Holieſt of Men bear Witneſs to it. And the Pretenſion of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:29455:191"/>
and Perfect State, is abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by that Anſwer, one of the moſt eminent of them, makes to an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which charges them with arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and aſſuming to themſelves Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility and Perfection, <hi>viz. That they were ſo far Infallible and Perfect, as they were led by the Spirit of God.</hi> For what is this, but to <hi>deſert</hi> and <hi>betray,</hi> not defend their Cauſe? 'Tis plain then, as to Matter of Fact, that the moſt <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> upon Earth are not without Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Infirmities; and ſuch Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as diſcover themſelves in actual Slips and Errors. But the Queſtion is, whether theſe are to be accounted <hi>Sins?</hi> I muſt confeſs if we ſtrictly follow the Language of the Scripture, we ſhould rather call them by ſome other Name; for this does ſo generally underſtand by Sin, a Deliberate Tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, that it will be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to produce <hi>many</hi> Texts wherein the Word <hi>Sin</hi> is uſed in any other ſenſe. As to <hi>Legal</hi> Pollutions, I have not much conſidered the matter. But as to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> ones I am in ſome Degree confident, that the word Sin does generally ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſuch a Tranſgreſſion as by the Goſpel
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:29455:191"/>
Covenant is puniſhable with Death; and <hi>rarely</hi> does it occur in any other ſenſe, I ſay <hi>rarely;</hi> for, if I be not much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, the Scripture does <hi>ſometimes</hi> call thoſe Infirmities I am now talking of Sin. But what if it did not? 'Tis plain, That every Deviation from the Law of God, if it has any Concurrence of the will in it, is in ſtrict ſpeaking <hi>Sin:</hi> and 'tis as plain that the Scripture does frequently give us ſuch Deſcriptions and Characters, and ſuch Names of theſe Sins of Infirmity, as do oblige us both to ſtrive and watch againſt them, and repent of them. For it calls them Spots, Errors, Defects, Slips, and the like. But, what is, Laſtly, moſt to my purpoſe, it is plain, That this Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins, into Mortal, and Venial, or Sins of Infirmity, has its Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in expreſs Texts of Scripture. Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous are the Texts cited to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: But he that will deal fairly muſt confeſs, that they are moſt of them improperly and impertinently urged, as relating either to Falls into Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Calamity, or to Mortal, not Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, Sins; or to the Sins of an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate State; or to a comparative
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:29455:192"/>
Impurity, I mean the Impurity of Man with reſpect to God; a Form of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion frequent in <hi>Job.</hi> I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore content my ſelf to cite three or four, which ſeem not liable to theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, Deut, 32.4. <hi>they have corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves; their Spot is not the ſpot of his Children: They are a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and crooked Generation.</hi> Here two things ſeem to be pointed out to us plainly, Firſt, That the Children of God are not without their Spots, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That theſe are not of the ſame Nature with thoſe of the wicked, in compariſon with whoſe wilful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Tranſgreſſions, the Children of God are, elſewhere, pronounced blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs without Offence, without Spot, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12, 13. <hi>Who can underſtand his Errors? cleanſe thou me from ſecret Faults: keep back alſo thy Servant from preſumptuous Sins, let them not have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over me, then ſhall I be upright and I ſhall be innocent from the great Tranſgreſſion.</hi> Here again the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſeems to me to place Uprightneſs in Freedom from Deliberate or Mortal Sin, and to admit of another ſort of Tranſgreſſions, into which, even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right

Men ſlip ſometimes. Nor does the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> here only aſſert Venial Sins, but he ſeems to me to ſuggeſt the Springs and Sources of them, namely, ſome ſecret Diſpoſitions in our Nature to Folly and Error, which he prays God to cleanſe and free him from more and more; <hi>cleanſe thou me from ſecret Faults.</hi> The word <hi>Fault</hi> is not in the Original; but ſomething of that kind muſt be ſupplied to render the ſenſe entire in our Language. The words of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 20.9. ſeem to relate to this Corruption lurking in us, and never utterly to be extirpated; <hi>Who can ſay I have made my Heart clean, I am pure from my Sin?</hi> For if this ſhould be applied to Mortal Sin, every one ſees, that it will contradict a hundred places in Scripture, which attribute to Righteous Men, Purity of Heart, and Deliverance from Sin. Laſtly, <hi>James</hi> 3.2. we are told plainly, that <hi>in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things we offend all,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; not Sinners only, but Righteous and Upright Men, have their Defects and Slips. And accordingly there is not any Life which we have the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of in Scripture, how excellent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:29455:193"/>
the Perſon be, but we meet with ſome of theſe recorded; as will appear from thoſe ſeveral Inſtances I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, when I come to deſcribe the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe Sins. And certainly when <hi>David</hi> ſays of himſelf, <hi>my Sins are more in number than the hairs of my head.</hi> He that ſhall interpret this Place of Mortal or Preſumptuous Sins, will both contradict the Scriptures, which acquit him, except in the matter of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and highly wrong the Memory of <hi>David,</hi> making him a Prodigy of Wickedneſs, inſtead of a Saint. Nor does <hi>that</hi> make any thing againſt me, which he adds in the next Words, <hi>my heart fails me;</hi> or <hi>that</hi> in the foregoing Verſe, <hi>mine Iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to look up.</hi> For I do not affirm that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> here has regard only to Sins of Infirmity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively of others, no, he reckons all together, and ſo diſcerns the one ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by the other; and the Guilt of all together very far enhanſed. Nor do I, <hi>Secondly,</hi> intereſs my ſelf here in that Diſpute between Proteſtants and Papiſts, whether Sins of Infirmity are not damnable in their own Nature
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:29455:193"/>
though not imputed under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace? Nor do I, Laſtly, examine what a vaſt Heap of Sins of Infirmity may amount to, though the Gilt of this or that alone were not ſo fatal. I have then, I think, proved the matter in Queſtion; having ſhewed both from the Experience of Mankind, and the Scripture, That the beſt Men have their Infirmities and Defects; And that theſe may properly enough be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sins. I think it ſuperfluous to prove, that they conſiſt with a ſtate of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſince 'tis not by any, that I know of, denied; and may be eaſily enough made out, from what I have already ſaid. I am now to Enquire,</p>
               <p>S. 2. What theſe Sins be; and how diſtinguiſhed from Mortal or Damnable ones. To this purpoſe we may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh Human Actions (under which I compriſe both Internal and External) into three ſorts, Voluntary, Involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Mixt.</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. There are Actions properly and truly Voluntary; ſuch are thoſe delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Tranſgreſſions of a Divine Law, which Man commits in Oppoſition to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:29455:194"/>
the direct Remonſtrances of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; he knows the Action is forbid, he ſees the Turpitude and Obliquity of it; he is not ignorant of the puniſhment denounced againſt it, and yet he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon it: This is plainly Mortal, Damnable Sin, and I cannot think, that any Circumſtance or Pretence whatever, can render it Venial. And therefore I muſt be pardoned, if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of their Opinion who ſuppoſed, that the ſmalneſs of the Matter, the Reluctancy of Conſcience, or the Length and Force of a Temptation, can ſo ſoften and mitigate a Voluntary Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, as to diminiſh it into a Sin of Infirmity. 1. As to the ſmalneſs of the Matter. Some cannot but think thoſe Tranſgreſſions Venial, which are, for the Matter of them, ſo ſlight and inſignificant, that they ſeem to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by no miſchievous Con<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence, nor to offer any Diſhonour to God, nor Injuſtice to Man. But I doubt this Notion of Venial Sin has no Solidity in it; For either Men perform ſuch Actions Deliberately, or Indeliberately, knowing them to be ſinful, or belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to be innocent. Now if
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:29455:194"/>
we perform any Action Deliberately, and knowing it to be ſinful, we never ought to look upon this as a <hi>little</hi> Sin, much leſs a <hi>Venial</hi> one. The Reaſon of this is plain. The Firſt Notion that every Man has of Sin, is, that it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by, and diſpleaſing to God; and then to do that deliberately, which we know will provoke God, is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a fearleſs and irreligious Heart, a Heart deſtitute of the Love of God, the Love of Righteouſneſs, and Heaven. But if a Man tranſgreſs in a <hi>trifling In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance indeliberately;</hi> this alters the Caſe; for the Matter not being of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance enough to excite the Intention and Application of the Mind: and there being conſequently no Malignity of the Will in an Action, where there was no Concurrence of the Judgment, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think, this may very well paſs for an Human Infirmity; for all the fault that can be here laid to the Charge of Man is, Incogitancy or Inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and that too as excuſable a one as can be. Laſtly, where the Matter of an Action is very trifling and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, and draws after it no ill Conſequence, either with reſpect to
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:29455:195"/>
God or Man, in this Caſe, if a Man judge it no Sin, I cannot think it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> any to him; though by a Nice and Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Conſtruction, it may fall within the Compaſs of ſome Divine Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Diſtinction of the Schoolmen is good enough here; it is beſides the Law, but not againſt it: or it is againſt the Letter, but not the Deſign and Intention of the Law of God. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that it is conſiſtent with the Infinite Goodneſs of God, to puniſh ſuch things as theſe with Eternal Miſery, or that it can become a Man of ſenſe, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to afflict his Soul for them. I cannot for my Life, perſwade my ſelf that I ſhould provoke God, if paſſing thorough a Field of my Neighbour's Corn or Peaſe, I ſhould pull off an Ear or Cod; or paſſing through his Orchard, ſhould eat an Apple. The Notion I have of God, and the great End and Deſign of his Laws will not ſuffer me to entertain ſuch trifling, weak, and ſuperſtitious Fancies. And here I cannot but take notice of two Things, which very much perplex the Minds of ſome good People; that is an Idle <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Jeſting:</hi> concerning both
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:29455:195"/>
which, 'tis very plain, That ſuch are miſerably miſtaken; and that they are no ſins at all, unleſs unreaſonable and ſuperſtitious ſcruples make them ſo: This I ſay, on ſuppoſition, that by Idle word, they mean <hi>only</hi> ſuch talk, as does not tend to Edification; and by Jeſting only <hi>that</hi> which is Innocent and Divertive. By an Idle Word (<hi>Matt.</hi> 12.) our Saviour plainly means a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Word, if that ſaying of our Saviour, of every <hi>idle Word,</hi> &amp;c. be to be limited, and confined by the ſenſe of the Context: For the occaſion of that Aſſertion of our Lord, was the Blaſphemy which the <hi>Jews</hi> belch'd out againſt his Miracles. Or if our Lord here, on this occaſion, advances a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Doctrine, then, by an Idle Word, we muſt underſtand a wicked one, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a corrupt and naughty Heart; and tending as directly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Impiety, as gracious and wholſome Diſcourſe does to promote Edification. This is evident from <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>a good Man, out of the good treaſure of the Heart, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good things;</hi> and an <hi>evil Man, out of the evil treaſure bringeth forth evil things. And</hi> ver. 37. <hi>for by thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:29455:196"/>
ſhalt be condemned.</hi> By <hi>Jeſting, Eph.</hi> 5.4. The Apoſtle underſtands the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Raillery</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which was generally made up of <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> and <hi>Wantonneſs;</hi> or brisk and ſharp Ironies. This is plain, both from the Company we find it in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Filthineſs and Fooliſh Speaking; and from the Character, given it in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the other two: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
being the very ſame, that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the moſt infamous, and vileſt Luſts and Paſſions. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. <hi>Things not convenient is</hi> a diminutive Expreſſion, implying ſuch things as contain much Turpitude and Wickedneſs in them. <hi>Beza,</hi> as appears by his Notes, read <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in this place, fooliſh ſpeaking, or (not and) Jeſting; which (as he obſerves) makes Jeſting the ſame thing with fooliſh Speaking, or Buffoonry. And juſtifies that Jeſting, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a pleaſant, and divertive Face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs from 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.27, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some think, that the meer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, and Oppoſition of Conſcience againſt Sin, is ſufficient to conſtitute a Sin of Infirmity. And this has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:29455:196"/>
no ſmall Countenance, from ſuch an Interpretation of <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. as makes Holineſs to be nothing elſe but a Viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude of Deſires and Actions, repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to one another. But at this rate no Man's Sins would be Damning but his, whoſe Conſcience were ſear'd, and when ones Heart did condemn one, God would be ſure to acquit one: which agrees very ill with St. <hi>John, If our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21. No man, unleſs arrived at a Reprobate Senſe, can do that which is evil without Reluctancy; for his Conſcience will forbid him, as long as it has the leaſt Degree of Tenderneſs in it; and reſtrain him as far as it has power. And as to <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. it has been abundantly conſider'd; and, I think, ſufficiently proved to belong to thoſe, who are the Servants of Sin; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. does to thoſe, who are ſet free. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> indeed tells us, that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that Chapter at firſt as the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geans</hi> did, for a Perſon under the Law, and under the Power of Sin; But that he found himſelf conſtrained afterwards, to underſtand it of St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf.
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:29455:197"/>
I will not examin the Solidity of his Reaſons: 'Tis enough to me, that his Change of Opinion does Religion no harm: For he is ſo far from making a ſtate of Holineſs to conſiſt with Acts of Deliberate Sin againſt Conſcience, that he will not excuſe ſo much, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Motions and Appetites, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to. All that he contends for, in a good Man from this Chapter is, That Lapſed Nature will ſometimes exert it ſelf, even in the beſt Men, in diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſtemper'd Appetites.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Others, Laſtly, will have thoſe Sins, into which we fall, either over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd by the ſtrength, or wearied out by the Aſſiduity or Length of a Temptation, paſs for Infirmities. But this Opinion has as little ground as the two former. I can find no Scripture that countenances this Notion. There are indeed, ſome of great Reputation, who have promoted it; But, I think, the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> make againſt it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>There hath no temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken you, but ſuch as is common to Man; but God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:29455:197"/>
alſo make a way to eſcape; that ye may be able to bear it.</hi> The Deſign, of which Words, is certainly, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Chriſtians againſt the bigeſt Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, by an Aſſurance of Relief from God, proportionable to our Neceſſities; and conſequently muſt imply, that if we yield to a Temptation, 'tis our own fault. God expects, we ſhould ſtand firm, under the higheſt Trials. <hi>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life,</hi> Rev. 2.10. <hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet down with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Throne,</hi> Rev. 3.21. <hi>But whoſoever ſhall deny me before Men, him will I alſo deny before my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Matt. 10.33. If therefore, by Sins of Infirmity, Men mean, ſuch as are conſiſtent with the ſtate of Grace. <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as good Men may frequently fall into, without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting the Peace of Conſcience, and the Favour of God, I cannot poſſibly think, that any Deliberate Sin, can be ſuch, upon the ſcore of the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or that any of thoſe Sins, reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Catalogue, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:29455:198"/>
can be ſuch on the account of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence or Perſeverance, with which, they attack us. But, Secondly, if by Sins of Infirmity they mean, ſuch Sins as Righteous Men are liable to, I know not what they are, from which, they are exempted. But if, Laſtly, by Sins of Infirmity, they mean ſuch, for which God is more eaſily entreated, then there is no Queſtion to be made, but that there is a Difference in Sins; which is to be eſtimated, by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Meaſures of Grace and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; by the different Degrees of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation and Surpriſe; and by the Force or Weakneſs, the Continuance or Shortneſs, of a Temptation: And Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, by the different Effects, and Tendencies of Sins. To all which, I do not queſtion, but that the Spirit has regard in thoſe Directions, which it gives us, for our Behaviour towards ſuch as fall, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Brethren, if a Man be overtaken in a fault, ye, which are ſpiritual, reſtore ſuch a one in the Spirit of Meekneſs; conſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted. And of ſome have compaſſion, making a difference: And others ſave with fear, pulling them out of the fire,</hi> Jude 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:29455:198"/>§. 2. A Second ſort of Actions are ſuch, as we call Involuntary; that is, thoſe, wherein we exerciſe no Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, no Choice. Some have reduced Sins of Infirmity to this Head, but with what Colour of Reaſon any one may judge. For ſince Actions, truly <hi>Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,</hi> are neither the Object of the Underſtanding nor Will, 'tis hard to conceive what Morality there can be in them. The Grounds, on which this Opinion is built are ſuch as theſe. Firſt, the Meaſure, ſay they, of Good and Evil is the Law of God; But Involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and unavoidable Actions are not a proper Subject of Laws: for to what purpoſe is it to preſcribe Rules, or to propoſe Rewards and Puniſhments to ſuch Actions, as are no way ſubject to our Choice. Secondly, they tell us, 'tis inconſiſtent with the Goodneſs of God, and the Riches of Goſpel Grace, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute thoſe things to a Man as Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sins, which fall not within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of his Power of Deliberation. Now, I muſt confeſs, I am ſo far from denying any Actions, that can lay a juſt claim to this Apology to
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:29455:199"/>
be Venial, that I cannot forbear think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they are not ſinful: For <hi>where there is no Law there is no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</hi> But how does this way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, for the Excuſableneſs of Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Tranſgreſſions, conſiſt with thoſe other Doctrines which they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain concerning them; namely, That we are bound to Repentance for them; That theſe Sins are not Venial in their own Nature, but only through the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God. For the Law, taken in its Rigour, denounces Death againſt all Sin in general, without Limitation or Exception; ſo that if God ſhould judge rigorouſly, even Involuntary Sin, would fall under that Sentence, <hi>the wages of Sin is Death.</hi> This, I muſt confeſs, ſeems to me very incoherent. For if an Action be of that Nature, that it cannot properly be the Matter or Subject of a Law, how can it fall under the Condemnation of Law? If it be of that Nature, that it is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any Moral Regulation, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Influence of Reward or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, how can it be meer Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Grace, that a Man is not Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for it? In a word, if an Action be
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:29455:199"/>
truly, and properly Involuntary, it can by no means be Sin: and if it be Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, it is ſubject to the Regulation of Laws: 'Tis a proper Inſtance of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation and Freedom, and capable of Rewards and Puniſhments. And the Truth is, the one needs no Apology, and the other is not capable of any; the one is a Mortal Sin, and the other no Sin at all. And therefore, we muſt look for Venial Sin, in ſome other Species of Action.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. The laſt Claſs of Actions are thoſe which are of a mixt Nature; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Voluntary, and partly Involuntary: And here, I think, we muſt place Sins of Infirmity, by whatever Names we may call them. For theſe ſurely, if they are be rankt (as by all they are) amongſt Actual Sins, muſt be ſuch Actions, as have in them ſomething of Voluntary, ſomething of Involuntary, much of Human Frailty, and ſomething of Sinful, much of unavoidable, and ſomething of Moral Obliquity. Theſe are the Tranſgreſſions, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeems to me, to intend by Errors, Defects, Slips, Motes the Spots of
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:29455:200"/>
God's Children; and theſe certainly, if any, muſt be the Sins that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with a ſtate of Grace. For theſe do not imply a Deliberate Wickedneſs in the Will, much leſs an Habitual one; nay, they do not include in them any <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> at all, ſtrictly ſpeaking, but are truly the Effects of Human Frailty, and the unhappy Circumſtances of this Mortal Life. Thus then I deſcribe a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Sin; it has in it ſo much of Voluntary as to mak it Sin, ſo much of Involuntary as to make it Frailty; it has ſo much of the Will in it, that it is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced; and yet ſo much of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in it, it is never utterly to be extirpated: it has ſome thing in it Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal enough to oblige us to watch againſt it, repent of it; and yet ſo much in it pitiable and excuſable, as to entitle us to Pardon under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. And thus I diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Venial from Mortal Sin: Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin proceeds from a Heart, either Habitually corrupted, or deceived and captived for the time; but Venial Sin reſults from the Imperfections and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicities of our Nature, and our State. Mortal Sin is truly Voluntary and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate in the Rice and Birth of it,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:29455:200"/>
and miſchievous and injurious in its Conſequence: But Venial Sin is very far Indeliberate in its Beginning, and, if not indulged, almoſt harmleſs in its Effects: Deficiency is, as it were, the Eſſence of the one, Malignity of the other; in the one we ſee more of Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the other more of Wickedneſs: in the one ſomething nearly ally'd to Neceſſity, in the other to Preſumption: the one is the Tranſgreſſion of the Law of Perfection, the other of the Law of Sincerity; the one is repugnant to the Letter, the other to the Deſign and End of the Law; the one is a Violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God's Commands, taken in the moſt favourable Conſtruction, the other a Violation of them in a rigorous one. That this was the Notion of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and others, who impugn'd the ſinleſs Perfection of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> is very plain. 1. From the Diſtinction they made between <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="1">1. As to the Matter, I conceive, it ought to be <hi>ſlight</hi> and <hi>inconſiderable.</hi> There is no room for a Venial Sin in things of a crying provoking Nature; as in Adultery, Idolatry, Murther; for in theſe the Injuſtice and Wickedneſs, with reſpect to God and Man, is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and formidable; and can never, for ought I ſee, be extenuated by any Circumſtances into Sins of Infirmity. But when I ſay, the Matter of the Sin of Infirmity, muſt not be a deteſtable and crying Provocation, I do not mean to extend this to the firſt <hi>Tendencies</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> even towards ſuch Sins. Thus though Adultery cannot be a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Sin, yet the firſt Sallies of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the firſt Glances and Wandrings of the Eye, may. And the ſame thing may be ſaid, of the firſt Motions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any other Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the next thing to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a Venial Sin; that is, the <hi>manner</hi> of committing it, it muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from <hi>Ignorance, Frailty,</hi> or <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:29455:202"/>1. From <hi>Ignorance.</hi> By Ignorance I do not mean that which is utterly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible,</hi> but that which has ſome <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> ſome <hi>Frailty,</hi> ſome <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence</hi> it it. Of this kind, I take thoſe Errors to be, againſt which, <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12. <hi>who can underſtand his Errors? cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults.</hi> He that conſiders Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Power of Education; the Influence of Prejudices, which we ſuck in betimes, and ſuch-like, will eaſily acknowledge, that there may be ſuch Errors. When we have uſed a <hi>moral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence</hi> in examining our Lives, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own Hearts; Yet conſidering the vaſt Variety of Duties, we are to run through, no humble Man can be confident, that he has omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that he is miſtaken in nothing. This I take to be the ſenſe of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>who can ſay, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my Sin?</hi> And this I take to be the ſenſe of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>For I know nothing by my ſelf, yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</hi> There are Miſtakes and Errors, which might indeed have been prevented or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:29455:202"/>
by the <hi>ſtricteſt</hi> Impartiality, and the <hi>ſtricteſt</hi> Diligence. But alas! how often do good Men fall ſhort of both theſe? how common is it for good Men to be too far tranſported by the beſt of Principles, even Zeal? how often do good Men mix their Errors in Reproof and Reprehenſion, and in the one and the other, they diſcern it not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Surpriſe</hi> and <hi>Inadvertency</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, that renders Sin, Venial. The Multitude of Affairs and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the Suddenneſs and Unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedneſs of ſome unuſual Temptation, or ſomething of this kind, may betray a good Man into ſome Slips or Errors, in Word or Deed. This I take to be the Caſe of <hi>Sarah,</hi> when ſhe ſaid, <hi>I laughed not:</hi> of <hi>Jonah,</hi> when he repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon God, <hi>I do well to be angry,</hi> Jon. 3. Of <hi>David,</hi> when he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced raſhly, <hi>do thou and</hi> Zibah <hi>divide the Land,</hi> 2 Sam. 16.4. Of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> when they broke out, into Heat and Anger. But that which was a Sin of <hi>Infirmity</hi> in the beginning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, I doubt, a <hi>Deliberate</hi> one in the end, when they parted from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Some extend this Circumſtance
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:29455:203"/>
of Surpriſe to excuſe Sins, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply notorious Wickedneſs, and are of very ill Conſequence: But I think ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry erroneouſly. 'Tis true, theſe Sins of Surpriſe, whatever the matter of them be, are generally conceived, to be much extenuated, through want of Opportunity to ſummon our ſtrength, and to make uſe of mature and ſober Deliberation; eſpecially where the Temptation is not <hi>only ſudden,</hi> but <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent</hi> too. For in this caſe, the Soldier of Chriſt, taken, as it were, in an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh, or blown up with a Mine, ſeems to be loſt and defeated, before he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his Danger: I do not doubt then, but this ſuddenneſs of a Temptation, does very much diminiſh the Guilt of a Sin. But we ought to remember too, that there are many things, that do abate, and take off from this Excuſe: As Firſt, It is not eaſie to conceive how any thing, that is a direct Wickedneſs, that is a Sin of a deeper Die than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, on the account of its miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Conſequences, ſhould make its Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſo ſilently, and ſo ſuddenly, that we ſhould fall into it indiſcernably. Secondly, The Chriſtian is bound to
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:29455:203"/>
ſhun not only every Evil, but every <hi>Appearance</hi> of it; and 'tis hard to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that a ſincere Man, who does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſtrain at a <hi>Gnat,</hi> ſhould ſwallow a <hi>Camel.</hi> He that preſerves the Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Conſcience, as he will have an <hi>Averſion</hi> for <hi>ſmall Sins,</hi> ſo will he have an <hi>Horror</hi> for <hi>great ones.</hi> Thirdly, The Mind of a Chriſtian ought to be poſſeſſed and awed by the Fear of God; and <hi>that</hi> not a ſlight and tranſient, but a deep and laſting one. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> was not content to ſay, <hi>I am afraid of thy Judments,</hi> but to expreſs how tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly this Fear had ſeized him, he adds, <hi>my fleſh trembleth for Fear of thee,</hi> Pſal. 119. And certainly, this Fear is a ſort of impenetrable Armour, which extinguiſhes all the fiery Darts of the Devil. In vain is the Suddenneſs, or the Briskneſs of a Temptation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we firſt lay aſide this Shield. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, We are bound to be always on our Watch and Guard; and therefore if we relax our Diſcipline, if we live ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and careleſs, if we raſhly caſt our ſelves upon Dangers, our Sin then will be but the Conſequence of our Folly: and therefore one Error cannot be an
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:29455:204"/>
Excuſe or an Apology for another. I think therefore, the Apology of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, ſhould be confin'd and limited to <hi>ſlight</hi> Offences; it cannot properly have room in <hi>great</hi> ones, or if it have, it may be urged in <hi>Mitigation</hi> of our Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; but never, I doubt, for <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Impunity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, Venial Sin has its Riſe from the Defects and Imperfections of our <hi>Nature,</hi> and the diſadvantageous Circumſtances of our <hi>State.</hi> Here come in the Failures and Defects in the <hi>Meaſures</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> of Duty; if theſe can be properly reckon'd for Sins: I ſay, if they can; For I do not ſee that this is a good Argument, we are bound to the higheſt Degree of Love by that Law, <hi>thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever falls ſhort, of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt abſolute Degree of Love, is a Sin: For at this Rate, whatever were ſhort of Perfection, would be Sin. We muſt love nothing better than God, nothing equal to Him: This will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute us in a State of Sincerity. What is further required is, that we are bound to <hi>aim</hi> at, and <hi>purſue</hi> after the higheſt,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:29455:204"/>
and moſt perfect Degrees of Love: but we are not bound under Pain of <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> to <hi>attain</hi> them. But on the other hand, I readily grant, that our falling ſhort, in the Degrees of Faith, Love, Hope, and the like, may be properly reckoned amongſt Sins; when they ſpring from Defects of Vigilance and Induſtry: And if theſe Defects be ſuch, as can conſiſt with Sincerity, then are the Imperfections, or the Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Virtues, pardonable; and then only. Here again fall in <hi>Omiſſions, wandring Thoughts, Dulneſs</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs</hi> in Duty, the ſhort <hi>Titillations</hi> of ſome <hi>irregular Fancies, Forgetfulneſs,</hi> ſlight and ſhort <hi>Fits</hi> of <hi>Envy, Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Anger, Ambition, Gaiety</hi> of Mind. Thus we find the Diſciples falling aſleep, when they ſhould have pray'd, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. and <hi>David</hi> praying, <hi>quicken thou me, Pſal.</hi> 119. Thus his Soul too was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten caſt down, and diſquieted within him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.18, 19. <hi>Job</hi> curſed the Day of his Birth. In ſhort, our Natures are <hi>Human</hi> not <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical;</hi> and our State is full of Variety of Accidents, that they are too apt to diſcompoſe the Mind and divert it from <pb n="398" facs="tcp:29455:205"/>
its great End. The Ebbs and Flows of Blood and Spirits, and an unlucky con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or a Diſtemper; the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or Confuſion of Affairs; the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence or the Length of Tryals, the Eaſe and Flattery of Proſperity, the Wearineſs of the Body, or of the Mind, the Incommodiouſneſs of Fortune, Roughneſs of Converſation, theſe, and a thouſand other things, are apt to produce Defects and Failures in our Obedience, ſhort Diſorders in our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and ſuch Emotions and Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as abundantly prove the beſt to be but Men; and the higheſt Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it be but Human, to be wanting and defective. I think, I have now omitted nothing neceſſary to form a true Notion of Sin of Infirmity. My next buſineſs therefore is, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
               <p>S. 3. How far the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Perfect Man, in reſpect of <hi>Venial Sin,</hi> ought to be extended. There is great Affinity between Venial and Original Sin; and therefore the Perfect Man's Liberty, as it relates to the one and the other, conſiſts in much the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:29455:205"/>
and is to be attain'd by the ſame Method; ſo that I might well enough diſmiſs this Subject, and paſs on to Mortal Sin. But reflecting on the Nature of Man, how prone we are to Sin, and yet how apt we are to think well of our ſelves, I judge it neceſſary to guard the Doctrine of Venial Sin, by ſome few Rules, which may at once ſerve to ſecure our ſincerity, and point out the Perfection we are to aſpire to. 1ſt. then, If we would prevent any fatal event of Sins flowing from <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> we muſt take care, that our Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance it ſelf be not <hi>Criminal:</hi> and that it will not be, if our Hearts be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely diſpoſed to do our Duty, and if we uſe moral Diligence to know it: if we be impartial, humble, and honeſt, and have that Concern for the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Practiſe of our Duty, that is in ſome ſort, proportionable to the Importance of it. The Ignorance, that ariſes from natural Incapacity, or want of ſufficient Revelation, is <hi>invincible;</hi> and therefore <hi>innocent,</hi> Joh. 9.41. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaid unto them, if ye were blind ye ſhould have no Sin, but now ye ſay we ſee, therefore your Sin remaineth:</hi> and,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:29455:206"/>
15.22. <hi>if I had not come and ſpoken unto them they had not had Sin: but now they have no cloke for their Sins.</hi> This Rule muſt be underſtood of <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> Knowledge in General; and more <hi>legible</hi> and <hi>conſpicuous</hi> Lines of Duty: Both which, notwithſtanding there may be room for Sins of Infirmity to enter, where Mortal ones cannot: there may be imperfect Diſpoſitions of Mind, and latent Prejudices; there may be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Duty of a ſlighter moment; there may be ſeveral Circumſtances, and ſmall Emergencies that may either be, without the Aim, or eſcape the Diſcovery of a moral Search, that is, of a Human one: which, though it be without <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> is yet not without more or leſs <hi>Frailty.</hi> As to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it differs in this, as it does in other Caſes, from ſincerity only in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, by which it is advanced above it. He that will be Perfect, muſt ſearch for Wiſdom as for hid Treaſures: his Delight muſt be in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law muſt be meditate day and night: his Thirſt of Truth muſt be more eager, and impatient, his Diligence more wakeful, more
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:29455:206"/>
circumſpect, more particular, more ſteady and conſtant than that of the Beginner; or of one who is no farther advanced, than ſuch Meaſures of Faith and Love, as are indiſpenſably neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Sincerity, will carry him. 2ly. Sins that are occaſion'd by <hi>Surpriſe</hi> and <hi>Inadvertency</hi> will not prove deſtructive; if the <hi>Inadvertency</hi> it ſelf be in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>innocent:</hi> That is, Firſt, there is no room for Inadvertency in compleat Acts of crying Sins. Secondly, There is no pretence for Inadvertency, if we had any Miſgivings within, or Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings without concerning that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sin, into which we fell afterwards; much leſs, if we cheriſh ill Motions till they grow too ſtrong for us. And Laſt of all, if we repeat the ſame Sin frequently and contemptuouſly. And to this I may add, he cannot be ſaid to Sin through Surpriſe, who throws himſelf into the Way of Temptation, even though he be conſcious of his own Infirmity. 3ly. As to thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Defects, which flow from <hi>natural Infirmity,</hi> they will not deſtroy us; if the Infirmity it ſelf be pardonable. There are Infirmities which we acquire;
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:29455:207"/>
Infirmities which grow ſtronger by Indulgence; Infirmities which continue meerly becauſe we do not take Pains to ſubdue them: Our Moral Defects muſt not flow from theſe kinds of Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but from ſuch, as conſidering Human Nature, and the State of this World, 'tis impoſſible utterly to root out. Theſe moral Defects will do us no harm; if, Firſt, we take Care to ſettle in our Minds the Habits of thoſe Vertues that are directly oppoſite to them. Secondly, If we watch and fight againſt our natural Infirmities; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reduce our Appetites, even our natural Appetites, within ſtrict and narrow Bounds. Thirdly, If we waſh off the Stains of our Slips, and Defects by a general Repentance: For upon the Notion I have here given of Venial Sin, Repentance appears to be very neceſſary: for I require in them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Voluntary, ſometing of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; enough to make an Action ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, though not to prove the Heart cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, or wicked. And becauſe the Degrees of Voluntary and Involuntary, are not ſo eaſily diſtinguiſhable from one another, 'tis plain, our beſt ſecurity
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:29455:207"/>
againſt any ill Conſequence of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Frailties is a Godly Sorrow. And therefore I wonder not, if <hi>David</hi> charge himſelf more ſeverely than God does, <hi>my Sins are more in number than the hairs of my head: this</hi> was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that became the Humility and Sollicitude of a Penitent; That became the Reflections of a wiſe and Perfect Man; and the Corruption of Human Nature; the Alloy of Human Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances; the ſlips and Defects; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions, Neglects, and Deviations of the beſt Life.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of Liberty as it imports Freedom or Deliverance from Mortal Sin.</head>
               <p>HERE I will Enquiry into three Things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What Mortal Sin is; or what kind of Sins they be, which are on all hands acknowledg'd, to be Inconſiſtent with a ſtate of Grace and Favour.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:29455:208"/>2. How far, the Perfect Man muſt be ſet free, or deliver'd from this kind of Sins; or how remote he is from the Guilt of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Which way this Liberty may be beſt attained.</p>
               <p>S. 1. The Firſt thing neceſſary is, to ſtate the Notion of that Sin, which paſſes under the Name of <hi>Mortal, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Preſumptuous,</hi> or <hi>Deliberate</hi> Sin: For theſe in Writers are equivalent Terms, and promiſcuouſly uſed to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie one and the ſame thing. Sin (ſaith St. <hi>John</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 3.4.) <hi>is the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law.</hi> This is a plain and full Definition too of Sin. For the Law of God is the Rule of Moral Actions; 'tis the Standard and Meaſure of Right and Wrong, of moral Good and Evil: whatever is not within the Compaſs of the Law, is not within the Compaſs of Morality neither: whatever cannot be comprehended within this Definition, cannot have in it the entire and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Notion of Sin; or, which is all one, it cannot be Sin, in a ſtrict, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and adequate Senſe of the Word: Hence St. <hi>John</hi> in the ſame Verſe tells us,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:29455:208"/>
That <hi>whoſoer ſinneth tranſgreſſeth a Law;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 4.15. <hi>where there is no Law there is no Tranſgreſſion.</hi> Sin then muſt alwaies ſuppoſe a Law; without which, there can be neither Vice nor Vertue, Righteouſneſs nor Wickedneſs: For theſe are nothing elſe, but the Violation or Obſervation of the Law of God; or Habits and States reſulting from the one or the other. But this is not all. Two Things more muſt be remark'd to render this Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, which the Apoſtle gives us of Sin, clear and full. Firſt, The Law muſt be <hi>ſufficiently reveal'd.</hi> Secondly, The Tranſgreſſion of it muſt be truly <hi>Voluntary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. By ſufficient Revelation of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law every one underſtands, That the Law muſt be ſo publiſh'd to the Man, who is to be govern'd by it, that the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> of it may be, if it be not his own fault, render'd evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to him. If the Divine Authority of any Rule or Precept be doubtful and uncertain, the Obligation of it will be ſo too; And it is as neceſſary, that the ſenſe of the Law ſhould be evident, as its Authority. The Law that is pen'd
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:29455:209"/>
in dark and ambiguous Terms is, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking, no Law at all. Since the Mind of the Law-giver is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently made known by it. Whatever is neceſſarily, to be forborn or done by us, muſt be fully and clearly preſcribed in the Law of God; and if it be not, it can never be neceſſary. Men, through Weakneſs or Deſign, may Enact Laws that are but a heap of Letters, a Crowd of dubious, Delphick Sentences. But God can never do ſo; becauſe this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant both to his Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to the very End of a Law too: which is to be a Rule not a Snare; 'tis to give Underſtanding to the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; to be a Light to our Feet, and a Lamp to our Paths: not, like an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> to betray us into Brakes, and Precipices, and Ruin, and Death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Tranſgreſſion muſt be a <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary</hi> one. And this imports two Things. 1. A Knowledge of Law. 2. A Conſent to the Breach of it. Firſt, As to the Knowledge of the Law. All that I have to ſay here, in few words, is, That Ignorance of the Law excuſes a Tranſgreſſion when it is it ſelf excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable; but if the Ignorance it ſelf be
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:29455:209"/>
Criminal, the effect of it muſt be ſo too. We muſt never think of excuſing our Sins by alledging an Ignorance, into which, not our own Incapacity, or any other reaſonable Cauſe, but Neglect or Contempt of the Truth, or ſome other vicious Luſt or Paſſion, has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd us. Secondly, As to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Will. This is neceſſary to demonſtrate any Action ſinful or vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; without this, the Mind will be no Partner in the Sin; and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence cannot be involved in the Guilt of it. Whatever we cannot help is our Misfortune, not our Fault, Actions meerly natural, or meerly forc'd, can neither be good nor evil. The concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Reaſon and Choice, is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary, to the Morality of an Action. All this is plainly taught us by St. <hi>James</hi> 1.14, 15. <hi>But every Man is tempted; when he is drawn away of his own Luſt, and enticed; then when Luſt hath conceived it bringeth forth Sin; and Sin when it is finiſhed bringeth forth Death.</hi> Which words do certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imply, That the Spring and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Sin is within our ſelves; That 'tis our natural Corruption, that entices
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:29455:210"/>
and allures us; and 'tis our Conſent to its Enticements, that gives Being to Sin, and defiles us with Guilt.</p>
               <p>From all this now put together, 'tis eaſie to conclude, what ſort of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription we are to form of <hi>Mortal Sin.</hi> 'Tis ſuch a Tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, as is <hi>vicious</hi> in its <hi>Original, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> in its <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and <hi>Miſchievous</hi> in its <hi>Tendencies</hi> or <hi>Effects:</hi> The Heart is corrupted and miſled by ſome Luſt or other, and ſo conſents to the Breach of the Moral Law of God, a Law of Eternal and Immutable Goodneſs: or if the Sin conſiſts in the Breach of any Poſitive Law, it muſt yet imply in it ſome moral Obliquity in the Will; or in the Tendency of the Action, or both. So that Preſumptuous, or Mortal Sin, call it by what Name we Will, is a <hi>Deliberate</hi> Tranſgreſſion of a <hi>known</hi> Law of God, tending to the <hi>Diſhonour</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Injury</hi> of our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> or the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation</hi> of our <hi>Nature.</hi> Such are thoſe ſins which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts thoſe, who will repent, to ceaſe from. And ſuch are thoſe we have a Catalogue of <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>Now the Works of the Fleſh are
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:29455:210"/>
manifeſt, which are theſe, Adultery, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Laſciviouſneſs, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Hereſies, Envyings, Murders, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Revellings, and ſuch-like.</hi> Theſe are the ſins, of which, as of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Members, the Body of ſin conſiſts: Theſe conſtitute the old Man: Theſe are ſometimes called, <hi>the filthineſs of the Fleſh and Spirit, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs, Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Iniquity,</hi> the <hi>Lusts</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> worldly Luſts and ſuch-like. Theſe and the like ſins have, as I ſaid, in them very apparent Symptoms of Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Mortality: They are always the Effect of ſome carnal and worldly Luſts, prevailing over the Law of the Mind; and they imply a contempt of God, Injuſtice to our Neighbour, and ſome kind of Defilement, and Pollution of our Nature. And that theſe are the plain Indications, of ſuch a Guilt, as excludes a Man from Heaven, and the Favour of God, is very plain, from the account, which the Scripture gives us, both of the Origine and Influence of ſin; from the Care it takes to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Heart againſt all Infection, from
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:29455:211"/>
the conſtant Repreſentations it makes us of the ſhamefulneſs, and the Miſchief of ſin, even in Reference to this World, as well as the other. I cannot ſee any thing further neceſſary, to the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Deliberate, or Preſumptuous ſin; unleſs it be here fit to add, That it is Mortal, though it proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Heart. There is no need at all, that it ſhould be brought forth into Action, to render it Fatal, and Damnable. This is evident, not only from the Nature of Divine Worſhip, which muſt be entire, ſincere and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; and therefore can no more be reconciled to the Wickedneſs of our Hearts, than of our Actions; but alſo, from the expreſs words of our Saviour, <hi>Out of the Heart proceed Fornication, Adultery, Theft,</hi> &amp;c. And elſewhere, he pronounces the Adultery of the <hi>Heart Damnable,</hi> as well as that of the <hi>Body,</hi> Mat. 5.28. <hi>But I ſay unto you, that whoſoever looketh upon a Woman to luſt after her, hath committed Adultery already with her in his Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. 2. I am next to give ſome account of the Liberty of Perfect Man, in
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:29455:211"/>
reference to the ſin, I have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of. I ſhall not need to ſtop at any General or Preliminary Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; as, That Abſtinence from ſin regards all the Commandments of God alike; and to do otherwiſe were to mutilate and maim Religion, and to diſhonour God, while we pretend to worſhip and obey Him: For the Breach of any ſingle Commandment is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Violation of the Majeſty, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God, whatever Obſervance we may pay all the reſt: For, <hi>he that ſaid do not commit Adultery; ſaid alſo, do not kill. Now if thou commit no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a tranſgreſſor of the Law,</hi> Jam. 2.11. That the Reſtraints, Man is to lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, relate no leſs to the <hi>Luſts</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> than the <hi>Actions</hi> of the <hi>Body; Except your Righteouſneſs exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, you ſhall by no means enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5.10. That to begin well will avail us little, unleſs we finiſh well too. Univerſality, Sincerity, and Perſeverance are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acknowledged to be eſſential and indiſpenſable Properties of Saving, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:29455:212"/>
Faith. Theſe things therefore, being but juſt mentioned, I proceed to the Point to be enquir'd into, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be free, from the <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of Mortal Sin, is the firſt and loweſt ſtep; this is indiſpenſable to ſincerity, and abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation; <hi>Let not Sin reign in your mortal Bodies to fulfil the Luſts thereof, Rom.</hi> 6.12. And the advancing thus far, does, I acknowledge, conſtitute Man in a ſtate of Grace; For in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Men are Denominated righteous or wicked, not from ſingle Acts of Vice or Vertue, but from the Prevalence and Dominion, from the Habit or Cuſtom of the one, or the other, <hi>know ye not, that to whom ye yeild your ſelves Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to obey, his Servants ye are to whom ye obey: whether of Sin unto Death, or of Obedience unto Righteouſneſs? Rom.</hi> 6.16. But then I muſt here add two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks by way of Caution. 1ſt. We muſt not preſume too ſoon of Victory over an Habitual Sin. An evil Habit is not ſoon broken off; nor is it an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie Matter to reſolve, when we have ſet our ſelves free from the Power of
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:29455:212"/>
it. Sometimes the Temptation does not preſent it ſelf as often as it was wont; or not with the ſame Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages: ſometimes one Vice reſtrains us from another; ſometimes worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, or ſome little Change in our Temper, without any thorough Change in our Minds, puts us out of humour for a little while with a darling Sin; and ſometimes the Force and Clearneſs of Conviction, produces ſome pious Fits, which, though they do not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanquiſh a Luſt, do yet force it to give way and retreat for a while, and <hi>interrupt</hi> that Love which they do not <hi>exſtinguiſh:</hi> All this may be, and the work not yet be done; nor our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty yet gain'd. If therefore we fall, though but now and then, and though at ſome Diſtance of time, into the ſame ſin, we have great reaſon to be jealous of its Power and our Safety: Nay, though we reſtrain our ſelves from the outward Commiſſion of it, if yet, we feel a ſtrong Propenſion to it; if we diſcern our ſelves ready to take fire on the Appearance of a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; if we are fond of approaching as near it as we can, and are pleas'd
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:29455:213"/>
with thoſe Indulgencies, which are very near a kin to it, we have reaſon to doubt that our Conqueſt is not yet entire. Nay, the Truth is, we cannot be on good Grounds aſſured, that we are Maſters of our ſelves till we have a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Averſion for the ſin, which before we doted on; and ſhun the Occaſions, which before, we courted; till we be poſſeſs'd of a Habit of that Vertue, which is a direct Contradiction to it; and take as much pleaſure in the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as ever we did, in the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of a Divine Command.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. There are ſome Sins of that provoking Nature, ſo criminal in their Birth, and miſchievous in their Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, That one ſingle <hi>Act,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> of one of theſe, is equivalent to a <hi>Habit</hi> of others: ſuch is Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Idolatry, Perjury Adultery; theſe cannot be committed without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing <hi>Humanity,</hi> as well as <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> without reſiſting the Inſtincts, and Impulſes of Nature, as well as the Eight of the Goſpel, and the Grace of the Spirit. We muſt break thorough a great many Difficulties, and Terrors e're we can come at theſe Sins; we
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:29455:213"/>
muſt commit <hi>many</hi> other, in order, to commit <hi>one</hi> of theſe; we muſt delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate long, reſolve deſperately, and in Defiance of God and Conſcience; and what is the <hi>Effect</hi> of Habit in other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, is a neceſſary <hi>Preparative</hi> in theſe, that is, <hi>Obduration.</hi> In this Caſe therefore, the unhappy Man, that has been guilty of any one of theſe, muſt not look upon himſelf as ſet free, when he is come to a Reſolution of never repeating it again; But then when he loaths, and abhors himſelf, in Duſt and Aſhes, when he has made the utmoſt Reparation of the Wrong he is capable of: when, if the Intereſt of Vertue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, he is content to be oppreſs'd with Shame and Sufferings: when, in one word, a long and conſtant Courſe of Mortification, Prayers, Tears and good Works have waſhed off the Stain and Guilt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt be free, not only from a <hi>Habit,</hi> but from ſingle <hi>Acts</hi> of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate preſumptuous Sin. The Reaſon is plain; Mortal Sin cannot be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without wounding the Conſcience, grieving the Spirit, and renouncing our Hopes in God through Chriſt, for the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:29455:214"/>
time at leaſt. <hi>The wages of Sin is Death;</hi> is true, not only of Habits, but ſingle Acts of Deliberate Sin. Death is the penalty, the Sanction of every Commandment; and the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does not prohibit Habits only, but ſingle Acts too. Nor is there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any room for Doubt or Diſpute here, but in one Caſe; which is, If a Righteous Man ſhould be taken off in the very Commiſſion of a Sin, which he was fallen into? Here indeed, much may be ſaid, and with much Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But the Reſolution of this Point, does not, as far as I can ſee, miniſter to any good or neceſſary End; and therefore I will leave it to God. In all other Caſes, every thing is clear and plain; For if the Servant of God fall into a preſumptuous Sin, 'tis uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally acknowledg'd, that he cannot recover his Station but by Repentance. If he repent preſently, he is ſafe; but if he continue in his Sin, if he repeat it, he paſſes into a ſtate of Wickedneſs; widens the Breach between God and his Soul; declines inſenſibly into a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of ſin, and renders his Wound more and more incurable. 'Tis to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:29455:214"/>
I think here, to conſider the vaſt Difference there is in the Commiſſion, even of the ſame ſin, between a Child of God, and a Child of Wrath; becauſe a Child of God muſt not commit it at all: if he do, though it be with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, though it be, as it were, with an imperfect Conſent, and with a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Soul; though the Awe of Religion and Conſcience ſeems not utterly to have forſaken him, even in the midſt of his ſin, though his Heart ſmite him, the very Minute it is finiſh'd, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Remorſe take off the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of the unhappy Draught, yet ſtill 'tis Sin; 'tis in its Nature Damnable: and nothing but the Blood of Jeſus can purge the Guilt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Perfect Man may be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not only actually to abſtain from Mortal Sin, but to be advanced ſo far in the Mortification of all his inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Affections, as to do it with <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> with <hi>Conſtancy</hi> and <hi>Delight.</hi> For it muſt reaſonably be preſumed, that his Victory over ungodly and worldly Luſt, is more confirm'd and abſolute; his Abhorrence of them more deep and ſenſible, more fixt and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:29455:215"/>
than that of a Beginner or Babe in Chriſt. The Regenerate at firſt fears the Conſequence of ſin; but by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees he hates the Sin it ſelf. The Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Soul renders him now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of finding any pleaſure in what he doted on before; and the Love of God and Vertue raiſeth him above the Temptations which he was wont to fall by; <hi>old things are paſt away and all things are become new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, The Perfect Man's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence is not only more <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>steady,</hi> but more <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>compleat</hi> alſo, than that of others: He has a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the End and Deſign of the Law; to the Perfection of his Nature; to the Purity and Elevation of his Sowl; and therefore he expounds the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Law in the moſt enlarg'd Senſe, and interprets them by a Spirit of Faith and Love. He is not content to refrain from Actions directly cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, but ſhuns every Appearance of Evil; and labours to mortifie all the Diſpoſitions and Tendencies of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture towards it; and to decline what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Circumſtances of Life are apt to betray the Soul into a Love of this
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:29455:215"/>
World, or the Body: he has crucified the World and the Body too. That Pleaſure, that Honour, that Power, that Profit, which captives the Sinners, tempts, and tries, and diſquiets the Novice, is but a burthen, a trouble to him: he finds no Guſt, no reliſh in theſe things. He is ſo far from Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, ſo far from Wantonneſs, ſo far from Pride and Vanity, that could he without any Diſadvantage to the Intereſt of Religion, he would imitate the Meanneſs, the Plainneſs, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriouſneſs, the Self-denial of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Life; not only in Diſpoſition and Affection of his Soul, but even in his outward State and Deportment; and would prefer it far above the Pomp and Shew of Life. In one word, he enquires not how far he may <hi>Enjoy</hi> and be <hi>Safe,</hi> but how far he may <hi>deny</hi> himſelf and be <hi>wiſe:</hi> he is ſo far from deſiring forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Satisfactions, that he is unwilling and afraid to find too much Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the natural, and neceſſary Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an animal Life. I need not prove this to any one who has read the foregoing Chapters: for it is what I have been doing throughout this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:29455:216"/>
It is nothing, but what is conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the whole Tenour of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and to the Example of the beſt Times. And 'tis conformable to what the beſt Authors have writ, who have any thing of Life and Spirit in their Works: or have any true Notion of the great Deſign of Chriſtian Religion, which is, an heavenly Converſation. Let any one but caſt his Eye on St. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil,</hi> or any other after him, who aim'd at the ſame thing I now do, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting Holineſs in the World in the Beauty and Perfection of it, and he will acknowledge, that I am far from having carried this matter too high. I will quote but one or two Paſſages of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi>

               <p>I know not what Scruples or Miſtakes, the Doctrine I here advance concerning
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:29455:217"/>
this Part of my Perfect Man's Liberty, may be encounter'd with: But I am Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, I have given no juſt Occaſion for any. I do not ſay of the Perfect with <hi>Jovinian,</hi> that they cannot fall; but I ſay, they may, and ought to ſtand; and, if it be not their own fault, will do ſo. I do not affirm of them, as the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis</hi> did of their Part, that they are priviledg'd from ſin by a peculiar Grace, and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Favour; but I affirm, that they ſhall not want Grace to preſerve them from it, unleſs they be wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I do not go about to maintain that God ſees no ſin in his Children; but I maintain, That Mortal Sin is not the Spot of his Children. But do not I in this fall in with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who aſſert the Poſſibility of keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God? I anſwer, That taking them in the ſenſe, in which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Conference at <hi>Ratisbone</hi> defend this Doctrine, I do. They there tell us, that when they talk thus, they take the Law or Commands of God, not in a ſtrict and rigid; but in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable and equitable; <hi>i. e.</hi> a Goſpel Conſtruction: And this is ſo far from
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:29455:217"/>
being Heterodox, that <hi>Davenant</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it, a plain giving up the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in Controverſie. But am I not run into the Error of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and <hi>Quakers?</hi> I anſwer, if the one or the other aſſert, That the Perfect Man paſſes thorough the whole Courſe of Life without falling into any Sin; or, That in the beſt part of Life, he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peccable, and not ſubject to ſin (as in the Heat of Diſputation their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſeem ſometimes to faſten on them) I am at a wide Diſtance from them. But if they teach, That the Perfect Man has Grace and Strength enough to forbear Wilful Sin, and that many actually do ſo, I am I muſt confeſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly of their Mind. But then, I am at the ſame time of the ſame Mind with St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and St. <hi>Jerome</hi> too; For they teach the very ſame Doctrine: For they never contended about the Poſſibility of Freedom or Deliverance from <hi>Mental</hi> Sin, but only from <hi>Venial.</hi> St. <hi>Jerome</hi>

commonly admits; That Man may be <hi>ſine Crimine,</hi> but not <hi>ſine Peccato,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mortal, but not without Venial Sin. And in this, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of the Mind of the Scripture; which every where repreſents the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Man, as holy, blameleſs, undefiled, without Spot walking with God: and in one word, as free from Sin. If any Man can reconcile theſe Texts, which are very numerous, with Mortal Sin, I will not ſay in the beſt ſtate of the beſt Men, but a ſtate of Sincerity, and Regeneration, I will acknowledge my Miſtake. But till then, I cannot but think, the Doctrine I advance, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to eſtabliſh the true Notion of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; and convince us of our Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it. This Doctrine is again ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to wipe off thoſe Aſperſions and Calumnies, the <hi>Quakers</hi> caſt upon our Church; as if it held, That the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves may continue in their Sins; nay, cannot be freed from them. Our Church teaches indeed (<hi>Artic.</hi> 14.) That the moſt Perfect Men are never utterly exempt from Defects, Failings, and Human Infirmities; and I believe they themſelves are not confident e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:29455:218"/>
to teach otherwiſe: only they will not call theſe Infirmities Sins: And then the whole Controverſie is reduced to this; we agree in the thing, but differ in the Name; And in this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, we are not only on the humbler, but the ſafer ſide too: for acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Sins, we ſhall be the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſure, to be ſorry for them, to beg pardon of them and watch againſt them.</p>
               <p>The Fruit of this Liberty has been ſufficiently accounted for <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. And therefore I proceed.</p>
               <p>S. 3. To propoſe ſome Rules for the Attainment of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Mind muſt be grounded and rooted in the Faith; it muſt be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convinced and perſwaded of theſe great Articles of the Chriſtian Religion, That there is a God, and ſuch a God, Holy, Juſt, Omniſcient, and Omnipotent one; the Incarnation, Suffering and Glory of the Bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; a Judgment to come, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Rewards and Puniſhments of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Life. The firm Belief of theſe things does naturally promote theſe two Effects. 1. It will awaken a Sinner out of his Lethargy and Security; it
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:29455:219"/>
will diſturb him in his ſinful Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and fill his Mind with guilty Fears, and uneaſie Reflections. And when the Man finds no Reſt, no ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in his Sins, this will naturally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to endeavour the Conqueſt of them. But then, we muſt not ſtifle and ſuppreſs theſe Thoughts, we muſt give Conſcience full Liberty; we muſt hear the Dictates of our own Minds patiently; and conſider ſeriouſly thoſe terrible Truths, which they lay before us; till we go from this Exerciſe deeply impreſs'd with ſuch Notions as theſe: That our Sins, ſooner or later, will certainly bring upon us temporal and eternal Miſery; That nothing, but ſincere Righteouſneſs, can produce true and laſting Happineſs; That it is a dreadful Danger to dally too long with Indgination, or preſume too far on the Mercy of a juſt, and holy and Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God: That the neglecting the great Salvation tender'd by the Goſpel, and procured by the Bleſſed Jeſus, the ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the blood of the Covenant, and grieving the Holy Spirit (all which we do by willful Sin) is a Guilt, that will ſink down the obſtinate Sinner into the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:29455:219"/>
loweſt Hell; and render his Condition more intolerable, that that of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon, Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> 2. The Second Effect of the firm Belief of theſe Goſpel Truths, is, that it begets in us a Contempt of this World; and all the things of it. To him that Beelieves. How ſhort is Time compar'd to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? How falſe, how empty are the Pleaſures of Sin, compared with thoſe of Heaven, how inſignificant the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem or Love of Man to that of God? How worthleſs are all our worldly Hopes and Pretenſions in reſpect of an Intereſt in Jeſus? Now the Soul that is once poſſeſs'd thoroughly with theſe Notions, what will it not do, what will it not ſuffer, rather than fall ſhort of, or forfeit its Crown? In what ſtate will it not be contented, nay, in what ſtate will it not abound in Joy, whilſt it holds faſt the ſteadfaſtneſs of its Hope, and is ſecure of the Love of Jeſus? Here begins that Purity of Heart, which is the Fountain of true Epicureiſm, that Greatneſs of Mind which alone is true Honour and Fortitude. But that Faith may have theſe Effects upon us, it muſt not be only a <hi>true</hi> but a <hi>lively</hi> Faith: therefore my</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="428" facs="tcp:29455:220"/>2. Second Rule, or if you pleaſe, another Branch of the former Rule, ſhall be this. They, that will be free indeed, muſt not only believe the great Truths of the Goſpel, but muſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and ſeriouſly ponder them, till they have imprinted in themſelves as clear, diſtinct and perfect <hi>Ideas</hi> of them as we are capable of. This will ſoon mortifie the Appetites of the Body, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rrect our falſe Opinions of worldly Things; and baffle all the Sophiſtry and Confidence of Luſt. A lively Faith, is a Faith that imports the moſt clear and natural, the moſt full and enlarg'd Notions of its Objects; a Faith, that not only looks upon the Articles of our Creed as true, but beholds them in a manner as preſent; and ſo repreſented and drawn to the Life, that they fill the Soul with great and moving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. This Faith does not only Believe, that there is a God, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds Him and walks before Him as preſent; it ſees Him array'd in all his Glory, and in all his Majeſty, in all the Power, and all the Terrors, in all the Beauties and all the Graces of the Divine Nature: it does not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:29455:220"/>
that there are Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but is extreamly ſenſible of the Terrors of the one, and Attractions of the other; and looks upon both as at the door. It does not only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Mediator, but takes a full view of the Miſery of that ſtate, wherein we lay through Sin; and of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of that, into which, we are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the Redemption which is in Jeſus. It Contemplates this Mediatour in all the ſeveral ſteps of Condeſcenſion, and Humiliation; in all the Tenderneſs, and Tranſports of his Paſſion; in all the melancholy Scenes of his Sufferings; and the bright and chearful ones of his Glory. This is the Faith that ſets us free.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt not ſtop in Faith, till it be made perfect in Love. We muſt meditate Divine Truths till they have fired our Souls, till they have enkindled our Affections, till we be poſſeſs'd by an ardent Love of God, of Jeſus, of Righteouſneſs, and of Heaven; till all our other Deſires and Paſſions be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into, and ſwallowed up of Love; till God becomes the Center of our Souls; and in Him we reſt, in Him we
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:29455:221"/>
glory, and in Him we rejoyce. O Love, how great and glorious are the things that are ſaid of thee! 'Tis thou who doſt impregnate and animate Faith it ſelf; 'tis thou who doſt ſurmount the Difficulties of Duty, and make the Yoke of Chriſt eaſie and his Burthen light: 'tis thou, who doſt caſt out Fear, and make Religion full of Pleaſure; 'tis thou that doſt make us watchful againſt Temptations, and impatient under the Interruptions of Duty: 'tis thou that makeſt us diſ-reliſh the Pleaſures of this World, and long to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt. Here is the Liberty of the Sons of God. Bleſſed are they even in this World who attain it. But one Caution I muſt here add, That our Love muſt not be a <hi>Fleſh,</hi> a <hi>Bit,</hi> but a ſteady and well ſetled <hi>Affection,</hi> an Affection that has the <hi>Warmth</hi> of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and the <hi>Firmneſs</hi> of <hi>Habit.</hi> We muſt therefore by repeated Meditations, and Prayers, daily nouriſh this Flame of the Altar, and not ſuffer it to go out.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We muſt never be at reſt, till we have poſſeſs'd our Minds with a perfect <hi>Hatred</hi> of the ſin which we are moſt ſubject to. The Love of God, his Long-ſuffering
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:29455:221"/>
and forbearance, the Sufferings of Jeſus, the ſtruglings of the Spirit, the Peace and Pleaſure of Holineſs, the Guilt and Vexation, the Shame and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin, its ill Influence on our preſent Perfection, and Happineſs, on our Peace and Hopes, are proper To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks to effect this. A thorough Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Sin once ſetled and rooted in us, will produce that Sorrow, that Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that Watchfulneſs, that Zeal, which will remove us far enough, not only from the Sin, but alſo from the ordinary Temptations to it; and place us almoſt, without the Danger of a Relapſe.</p>
               <p>To this former Rule, I ſhould add this other; that when once a Man has reſolved upon a new Courſe of Life, whatever Difficulties he finds in his Ways, whatever Baffles he meets with, he muſt never quit the Deſgn of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Life: he muſt never give over Fighting, till he Conquer. The reaſon is plain; for he muſt either <hi>Conquer</hi> or <hi>Dye.</hi> But this belonging rather to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in Vertue, than the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, therefore I but juſt mention it.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:29455:222"/>5. It will not be imprudent in this Moral as in Phyſical Cures to obſerve diligently, and follow the Motions, and Tendencies of Nature. Where there are Seeds of Generoſity and Honour; the Turpitude and Shame of Sin, the Baſeneſs and Ingratitude of it, the Love of God and of Jeſus, and ſuch like, are fit Topicks to dwell upon. Where Fear is more apt to prevail, there the Terrors of the Lord are the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Motive: And ſo whatever the Frame and Conſtitution of Nature be, it will not be difficult to find Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Goſpel adapted to it, which will be ſo much the more <hi>prevalent,</hi> as they are the more <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, We muſt uſe all Means to obtain the Spirit of God; and to increaſe and cheriſh his Influence: We muſt ask, and ſeek, and knock, <hi>i. e.</hi> we muſt pray, and Meditate, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel with Patience, and with Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that our Heavenly Father may give us his Holy Spirit: And when we have it, we muſt not grieve it, by any Deliberate Sin; nor quench it by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity or Negligence, by ſenſual Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:29455:222"/>
and Preſumption; but we muſt cheriſh every Motion; improve every Deſire, and Paſſion, that it works in us: we muſt ſhun every Appearance of Evil: we muſt preſs on towards Perfection; we muſt watch unto Prayer; we muſt ſpend the Time of our ſojourning here in fear; we muſt rejoyce and glory in the Lord; and we muſt wait for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Hope, and the glorious appearance of the great God and our Saviour Chriſt Jeſus. And now I have finiſhed what I had to ſay on this Subject, of the Perfect Man's Liberty as it relates to Mortal or Wilful Sin. I have ſhewed what this Sin is; how far Man may be freed from it, and referring the Reader to <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. for the Fruit of this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. I have here, Laſtly, given that Advice which I thought moſt ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Attainment of it. And thorough this whole Chapter, I have had regard, not only to Perfection but Sincerity; it being indeed improper to do otherwiſe; ſince we cannot arrive at the one, but thorough the other. For Sincerity is Perfection in its Infancy, or Non-age: and Perfection is nothing elſe but Sincerity cultivated by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:29455:223"/>
and Diſcipline, and cheriſh'd by the Influence of Heaven. And now let no Man's Heart fail him while he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates the Difficulties which block up the Way to his Liberty. The Way indeed is ſteep, and the Top is high; but Serenity and Happineſs, Security and Glory dwell there. Many indeed are the Temptations which would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid our aſſent and thruſt us down: But we are Armed all over; they cannot hurt us; the Spirit ſupports and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages us; and nothing but our Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe and Inconſtancy can prevent our Succeſs: <hi>Watch ye, ſtand fast, quit ye like Men, be strong;</hi> and then, you ſhall be ſure to Conquer, and enter into Reſt.</p>

                  <hi>UNfruitfulneſs</hi> is a fit Subject to conclude a Diſcourſe of <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> with, or begin one of <hi>Zeal;</hi> for ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:29455:223"/>
like a Tract of Ground, between two bordering Kingdoms, it may indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently be laid to either. As it implies a direct Oppoſition to Spiritual Life and Sincerity, it naturally falls in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conſideration of Zeal; As it implies a Servile Subjection to ſome vile Luſt or or other, it naturally falls, in under the Conſideration of Liberty: So that by allotting it this Place, I ſhall at once compleat my Reflections on the Argument of Liberty, and make a good progreſs into that of Zeal.</p>
               <p>Barrenneſs, or Unfruitfulneſs may in general beſt be underſtood, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with a State of <hi>Wickedneſs:</hi> From which, as it is uſually diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Notion of the Vulgar, ſo does it really differ on many Accounts. The one has in it an Air of <hi>Defiance,</hi> the other of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconcernment</hi> for Religion; the one <hi>forgets</hi> God, the other <hi>contemns</hi> Him; the one has no <hi>Reliſh</hi> nor <hi>Savour</hi> of that which is <hi>good,</hi> the other finds too much <hi>Guſt</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in that which is <hi>evil;</hi> the one makes us by Degrees <hi>Enemies,</hi> the other <hi>Strangers</hi> to God. In ſhort, there is little Doubt to be made, but that the <hi>Omiſſion</hi> of a
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:29455:224"/>
                  <hi>Duty,</hi> and the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of a <hi>Crime; Lukewarmneſs</hi> in that which is <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>Eagerneſs</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> in that which is <hi>evil,</hi> may, and generally do differ very widely in the Degrees of Guilt: From hence it is (the Sinner being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a partial and indulgent Judge of himſelf) that it is not unuſual for many, who ſeem to have ſome Abhorrence of Wickedneſs, to be far enough from apprehending much Evil, or much Danger in Unfruitfulneſs. This is a fatal Error; it fruſtrates the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Religion, and robs it of its trueſt Honour, good Works. For what can Religion effect by that Man, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains nothing of it, but the bare Form and Profeſſion, and dares promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not only Impunity but a Heaven, in an uſeleſs and unprofitable Life?</p>
               <p>Unfruitfulneſs, if more particularly inquir'd into, conſiſts in two Things, a <hi>Neglect</hi> of <hi>Duty,</hi> or a <hi>lifeleſs</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable</hi> Performance of it. The For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer I will call <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> the Latter <hi>Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs, Coldneſs, Formality;</hi> and treat of each in order, Of the Former in this, and of the Latter in the following Chapter. And becauſe each of them
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:29455:224"/>
are encumbered with Miſtakes, and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which ariſe not only from Self-Love and Partiality, but alſo from Shallowneſs of Judgment, joyn'd with Tenderneſs of Conſcience, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour ſo to mannage this Subject, as neither to diſcourage the weak, nor embolden the careleſs.</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. Of Idleneſs. The Omiſſion of a Duty may be either <hi>Habitual</hi> or <hi>Occaſional</hi> and <hi>Accidental:</hi> And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Caſe of Omiſſion may be very different.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An <hi>Habitual Omiſſion</hi> of Duty cannot conſiſt with Sincerity: A ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Neglect of Duty defeats the main End of Religion, which is to Honour God, adorn our Holy Profeſſion, and promote the Good of Human Society; all which can never be attained but by following after Righteouſneſs, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in the Fruits of it. By this Rule, an <hi>idle,</hi> though <hi>innocent,</hi> Life muſt neceſſarily be accounted <hi>irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and vicious, being a flat Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to our excellent Profeſſion, He who does not pray, nor meditate,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:29455:225"/>
nor purſue any End of Charity, though he be otherwiſe civil and regular in his Life, yet becauſe be does not work Righteouſneſs, becauſe he is ſo far from imitating the Zeal or Charity of the Bleſſed Jeſus, that he acts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly repugnant to both; therefore muſt he not be looked upon, as a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Jeſus; but as an Alien, and a Stranger. He whoſe Life is ſpent in <hi>Vanity</hi> or <hi>Drudgery,</hi> in Pleaſure or Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, though his Pleaſure be not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,</hi> nor his Buſineſs <hi>unjuſt,</hi> yet is he, before God, a Criminal, becauſe unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: he has received the Grace of God in vain; the Light of the Goſpel has riſen upon him in vain; and he has ſerv'd no Intereſt of Vertue, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in his Generation: and therefore he will be excluded Heaven, with <hi>the ſlothful Servant, who hid his Maſters Talent in a Napkin,</hi> Luke 19.20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Caſe of an <hi>accidental,</hi> or <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional</hi> Omiſſion of Duty, is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of <hi>habitual</hi> Neglect of it: an <hi>occaſional Omiſſion</hi> may be, not only <hi>lawful,</hi> but <hi>neceſſary;</hi> but the <hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> of Duty never can be either. The
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:29455:225"/>
Circumſtances of poſitive Duty, and the Meaſures or Degrees of Moral Good, are not ſtrictly fix'd and ſetled; and therefore a ſingle Omiſſion, either in the one or the other, where-ever there is a ſufficient Reaſon for it, can neither grieve the Spirit, nor fruſtrate the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Religion; nor conſequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any Corruption in the Heart. But then we muſt take Care.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That our Omiſſion be not too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. We muſt always have regard, in this matter of Duty, to the great End and Deſigns of its Injunction; we muſt take care that our Omiſſions in moral Duties be not ſo often, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Honour of our Religion, or the Welfare of our Neighbour ſuffer by it, Nor muſt we ſo often omit Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Duties, Prayers, Reading, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the like, as thereby to <hi>abate,</hi> or much leſs <hi>extinguiſh,</hi> our Spiritual Guſt and Fervour. Omiſſion of Duty, too often repeated, breeds a kind of Indifference, or Lukewarmneſs; and ſoon paſſes into Coldneſs, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſs: and this often ends in a reprobate Mind, and an utter Averſion for Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:29455:226"/>2ly. We muſt endeavour, ſome way or other to compenſate the Omiſſion of a Duty; to make up by Charity, what we have defalc'd from Devotion; or to ſupply by ſhort Ejaculations, what we have been forc'd to retrench from fix'd and regular Offices of Prayer. And he that watches for Opportunities, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Improvement,</hi> or <hi>doing Good,</hi> will I believe, never have Reaſon to complain of the want of them: God will put into his hands either the one or the other; and for the Choice, he cannot do better, than follow God's.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. A ſingle Omiſſion muſt never proceed from a <hi>ſinful Motive;</hi> from a Love of the World or Indulgence to the Body; <hi>Neceſſity</hi> or <hi>Charity</hi> is the only juſt and proper Apology for it. <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> or Poſitive Duties may give way to <hi>moral</hi> ones; the Religion of the <hi>Means,</hi> to the Religion of the <hi>End:</hi> and in Moral Duties, the leſs may give way to the greater. But <hi>Duty</hi> muſt never give way to <hi>Sin,</hi> nor <hi>Religion</hi> to <hi>Intereſt</hi> or <hi>Pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus briefly given an account, what Omiſſion of Duty is, and what is not ſinful; and conſequently ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the notion of Idleneſs, that neither
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:29455:226"/>
the careleſs, nor the ſcrupulous, can eaſily miſtake their Caſe, I will now propoſe ſuch <hi>Conſidetations,</hi> as I judge moſt likely, to deter Men from it; and ſuch <hi>Advice,</hi> as may be the beſt Guard and Preſervative againſt it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Firſt Thing, I would have every one lay to heart is, That a State of Idleneſs is a State of damnable Sin. Idleneſs is directly repugnant to the great Ends of God, both in our <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and Redemption. As to our <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> can we imagine that God, who created not any thing but for ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent End, ſhould Create Man for none, or for a ſilly one? The Spirit within us, is an active and vivacious Principle: our rational Faculties capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate, and qualifie us for doing <hi>Good;</hi> this is the proper Work of Reaſon, the trueſt and moſt natural Pleaſure of a rational Soul. Who can think now, that our wiſe Creatour lighted this Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle within us, that we might oppreſs and ſtifle it by Negligence and Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? That he contriv'd and deſtin'd ſuch a Mind to ſquander, and fool a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way its Talents in Vanity and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence? As to our <hi>Redemption,</hi> 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent both what the Deſign of it is,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:29455:227"/>
and how oppoſite Idleneſs is to it. Chriſt gave himſelf for us, <hi>to Redeem us from all Iniquity; and to purifie to himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works,</hi> Tit. 2.14. and this is what our Regeneration, or Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aims at: <hi>We are God's Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, which God has before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them,</hi> Eph. 2.10. How little then can a uſeleſs and barred Life, anſwer the Expectations of God? What a miſerable Return muſt it be to the Blood of his Son; and how utterly muſt it diſappoint all the purpoſes of his Word, and Spirit? But What need I argue further, the Truth I contend for is the expreſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Doctrine of the Scriptures: is not <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> and <hi>fulneſs of Bread,</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned amongſt the Sins of <hi>Sodom?</hi> what means the Sentence againſt the <hi>barren Fig-tree, Luke</hi> 13.7. but the Deſtruction and Damnation of the Idle, and the Sluggiſh? the Indignation of God is not enkindled againſt the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs of <hi>Trees,</hi> but <hi>Men.</hi> What can be plainer, than the Condemnation of the unprofitable Servant, who periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:29455:227"/>
becauſe he had not improved his Talent, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.38. and how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently does the Apoſtle declare himſelf againſt the <hi>idle,</hi> and <hi>diſorderly?</hi> and all this proceeds upon plain and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Grounds: Our Lord was an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Vertue, as well as Innocence; and he did not only refrain from <hi>doing Evil,</hi> but he went about doing good. We can never ſatisfie the Intention of Divine Precepts, by <hi>Negative</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; when God prohibits the <hi>Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of the Fleſh and Spirit,</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns <hi>the perfecting Holineſs in his Fear:</hi> when he forbids us <hi>to do evil,</hi> he at the ſame time, preſcribes <hi>the learning to do well.</hi> What need I multiply more Words; Idleneſs is a flat Contradiction to Faith, Hope, Charity; to Fear, Vigilance, Mortification; and therefore certainly, muſt be a damning Sin; <hi>Theſe</hi> are all active, and vigorous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; but Idleneſs enfeebles and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirits, manacles and fetters us: <hi>Theſe</hi> are pure, ſtrict and ſelf-denying Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; but Idleneſs is ſoft, and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent: <hi>Theſe</hi> Conquer the World, and the Body, raiſe and exalt the Mind; but Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is far from enterpriſing any thing;
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:29455:228"/>
from attempting any thing that is good; it pompers the Body and effeminates, and diſſolves the Mind; and finally, whatever Innocence, or Inoffenſiveneſs it may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, it does not only terminate in Sin, but has its Beginning from it; from Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and Ignorance; from Vanity and Levity; from Softneſs, and Senſuality, from ſome prevailing Luſt, or other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next after the <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences</hi> of Idleneſs are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; and, if it be taken in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Latitude there is ſcarce any Sin, which is more juſtly liable to ſo many tragical Accuſations; for it is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of <hi>Diſhonour</hi> and <hi>Poverty;</hi> and of moſt of the <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Calamities</hi> of this mortal Life. But at preſent, I view it only as it is drawn with a half Face, and that the much leſs deformed of the two: I conſider it here, as pretending to <hi>Innocence;</hi> and flattering it ſelf with the Hopes of Happineſs: And yet even thus, ſuppoſing it, as harmleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive as it can be, yet ſtill, theſe will be the miſerable Effects of it: It will rob Religion, and the World of the Service due to both; it will bereave us of the Pleaſure of Life, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Death; and ſend us down at
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:29455:228"/>
laſt to a curſed Eternity. For where are the Vertues, that ſhould maintain the Order, and Beauty of Human Society; that ſhould relieve and redreſs the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the World? where are the Vertues that ſhould vindicate the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Religion, and demonſtrate its Divinity, as effectually as Predictions or Miracles can do? where are the bright Examples, that ſhould convert the unbelieving part of Mankind, and inflame the believing part with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Emulation? Certainly, the lazy Chriſtian, the ſlothful Servant, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to nothing of this kind. As to the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of Life, if true and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if pure and ſpiritual, 'tis eaſie to diſcern, from what Fountains it muſt be drawn. Nothing but Poverty of Spirit, can procure our Peace, nothing but Purity of Heart, our Pleaſure. But ah! how far are the Idle and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active from theſe Vertues? Faith, Love, and Hope are the Seeds of them: Victories and Triumphs, Devotion, Alms, and good Works, the Fruits of them: But what a ſtranger to theſe, is the Drone and Sluggard? Then for the <hi>Comfort</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> it muſt proceed from a well ſpent Life: he that ſees

nothing, but a vaſt Solitude and Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs behind him, will never, like the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſee a <hi>Canaan</hi> before him. Life muſt be fill'd with good Works, or elſe Death will look but dark and gloomy, when the Conſcience enquires every where after the Effects of the Word, and the Spirit, and the Blood of Jeſus; and can diſcover in all the parts, in all the paths of Life, no Tracks of any thing, but <hi>Fancy</hi> and <hi>Fortune, Humour</hi> and <hi>Indulgence:</hi> How will it ſhrink, and faint, and tremble; what penſive, melancholy Doubts, will damp and choke its Hope.

Alas, the Mind of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, is ſufficiently informed, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man ſhall receive according to what he has done in the Body; God will judge every Man according to his Works; what then muſt become of him, who has none to ſhew.

                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:29455:229"/>3. I might aggravate the Guilt of Idleneſs, by taking an Eſtimate of the <hi>Talents</hi> it waſtes, the <hi>Obligations</hi> it ſlights, and the <hi>Hopes</hi> it forfeits. I might render Man more jealous and apprehenſive of falling into it, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving how generally it prevails; which is a plain Proof, either of the ſtrength of the Temptation, or our Propenſion; a plain Proof, either that there is, I know not what ſecret Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick in the Sin, or elſe, that the Cheat, it impoſes upon the World, is a very clever, a very dexterous one. But I have ſaid enough; and where the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Conſiderations fail, theſe will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceed; Therefore I will now paſs on from Arguments to Advice; which was the next thing propoſed to be done.</p>
               <p>And here, my Advice muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to two different ſorts of Perſons. 1. To ſuch as are born to plentiful, or competent Fortunes. 2. To ſuch as are to raiſe their own; or to provide for the Support, and Maintenance of themſelves, and their Families, by their Labour or Induſtry, in ſome Calling or profeſſion. To the Former, the beſt Directions I can give are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:29455:230"/>1. He that is Maſter of his Time, ought to devote the more to Religion; <hi>to whom God has given much, of him much will be required:</hi> Nor has ſuch a one any Excuſe left, either for Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or a haſty, and curſory Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Duty, but one, one, that will increaſe his Guilt, <hi>i. e.</hi> Lazineſs, Pleaſure, or ſome Sin or other. Such a one therefore, ought to be conſtant, and diligent in frequenting the publick Aſſemblies of the Church; his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon Prayers, Sacraments, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, muſt be ſuch, as becomes a Man, who, as it has pleaſed God, ſeems born not to provide for Life, but only to live, only to improve, and enjoy Life; and carry on the nobler Deſigns of it: and as becomes a Man, whoſe good, or ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, is of ſuch vaſt Importance to the Service or Diſ-ſervice of Religion. Nor muſt ſuch a ones Attendance on the Publick, excuſe him from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Offices of the Cloſet, or his Family; he ought to abound in each: He may be more frequent in Meditation and Prayer; in Reading and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and perform each with more Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Solemnity than others can.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="449" facs="tcp:29455:230"/>2. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Fortune, ought to be careful in the Choice of Intimates, and Friends. Converſation is not always a Loſs, but ſometimes a Gain of Time: We often need to have our Forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs reliev'd, our Drowſineſs awaken'd, by the Diſcourſes and Reflections of our Friends. If Diſcourſe were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſeaſon'd with Grace, Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be the greateſt Bleſſing; if with Senſe, and Reaſon, Innocence, and Prudence, it would be the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Entertainment of Human Life. But how miſchievous is the Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which infects us with Vanity, and Lightneſs of Spirit, which ſhews us nothing, but a Gaudy out-ſide, and a Frothy Soul; whoſe Example binds Men in Civility to be fooliſh, and makes Confidence, and Vice, and Miſ-ſpence of Time, a Faſhion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It were to be wiſhed, That Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the beſt Rank, were ever bred up to ſomething; to ſomething, that might improve; to ſomething that might amuſe, and innocently engage their Minds; to ſomething, that might employ Life without encumbring it. And yet alas, what need I wiſh this;
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:29455:231"/>
how many excellent Qualities are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to render a Gentleman worthy of the Station, where God has placed him? Let him purſue <hi>theſe;</hi> how many are the Vertues, how many the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to which a Chriſtian is oblig'd? for him attend <hi>theſe;</hi> There is a great deal requiſite, to make a good Maſter, a good Husband, a good Father, a good Son, a good Neighbour, a good Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioner, an excellent Subject, and an excellent Friend! and yet there are many other Relations, beſides theſe. In a word, there is no Man, who when he ſhall appear before God, will not be found to have omitted many Duties; and to have perform'd many other with leſs Care, and Diligence, than he ought: and ſurely, ſuch a one cannot juſtly complain, for want of Buſineſs. I doubt rather on the contrary, That whoever takes a juſt and full view of things, will have reaſon to complain; That Life is ſhort, and our Work great; That let us uſe all the Diligence we can; and be as frugal of our Time as we will, we arrive much ſooner at a Maturity of Years, than of Knowledge and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:29455:231"/>4. The Diverſions of Perſons of this Quality, ought to be well regulated; ſuch as become the Character of a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi> and the Dignity of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that is, that muſt be neither <hi>mean</hi> nor <hi>vicious.</hi> But I have treated this, and the foregoing Heads, more copiouſly in Human Life; to which I refer my Reader.</p>
               <p>As to ſuch, in the next place, who are engag'd in a Profeſſion, I have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſidered their State in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Places; and find little to add here; but only to mind them, That they may be guilty of Idleneſs too; That their Idleneſs is the more criminal, the leſs Temptation they have to it. They may neglect the Duties of their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. I mean, their Secular Calling; and if they be unfaithful and negligent in their Temporal Concern, it is not to be expected, that they ſhould be more Sollicitous and Induſtrious about their Spiritual one. They may again, ſuffer the Cares of this Life to thruſt out thoſe of another; and then they are truly idle and ſlothful Servants to God, how induſtrious, and faithful ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, to the World: for Life

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of <hi>Unfruitfulneſs</hi> as it conſiſts in <hi>Lukewarmneſs, Coldneſs,</hi> or <hi>Formality.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the former Chapter, I conſider'd that part of Unfruitfulneſs, which conſiſts in the <hi>Omiſſion</hi> of Duty: I am now to conſider another part of it, which conſiſts in too <hi>perfunctory</hi> a <hi>Performance</hi> of it. Beſides thoſe, who are truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, becauſe they ſlight or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Duties of Religion; there is another Sort of Men, who at the laſt Day, will fall under the ſame Character, and Condemnation; not becauſe they perform no Duties, but becauſe their Performance of them is depretiated by Coldneſs, and Formality: Men, who make a fair Appearance of Religion, and yet have no inward ſpiritual Life:
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:29455:232"/>
Men, who do generally obſerve the external Duties of Religion, but with ſo little Guſt, with ſuch Indifference and Lukewarmneſs, that they are neither acceptable to God, nor uſeful to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This State of Deadneſs, may be conſider'd either more <hi>generally,</hi> as it runs thorough the whole courſe of our Lives and Actions; or more <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,</hi> in this or that Inſtance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When 'tis ſo general, that the Bent and Courſe of our Lives, is, for want of reliſh of the Things of God, perverted and depraved; when we have no Deſigns, drive on no Ends, that are ſuitable to the Excellency and <hi>Dignity</hi> of our <hi>Nature;</hi> to the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of our <hi>Profeſſion</hi> and to the great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt <hi>Obligations</hi> of God: when we have no Joys or Pleaſures, no Thirſts or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, that do truly become a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: when we make no Progreſs, no Advance towards our great End: when our Diſcourſes and Employments, have no Tincture of the Spirit, and no Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to Edification. I think we may then boldly conclude, that this is a
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:29455:233"/>
ſtate of <hi>Carnality,</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> And that this want of Reliſh in the general Courſe of our Lives, proceeds from a real want of a Sincere Faith, and true Illumination. For were the Mind, once truly Enlighten'd; were it once clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinc'd, firmly and habitually perſwaded, of the Beauty and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Things of God; as we ſhould have Notions different from thoſe of worldly, carnal Men, ſo would there conſequently be a Difference in the Nature of our Hopes, and Fears; of our Deſires and Deſigns; of our Joys and Sorrows; and as neceſſarily in the main Scope, and Tendency of of our Converſation. Whoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finds this general Stupidity in the Courſe of his Life, let him not flatter himſelf in the Performance of any of the Duties of Religion: he has a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, carnal and blind Heart; his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances proceed not from true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and have not that Life and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in them that they ought; they are as different from the Performances of a Man, truly regenerate, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, as the Civilities and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a well-bred Acquaintance,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:29455:233"/>
from the ſubſtantial Offices of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and affectionate Friend. Nor can any Man, who will take the leaſt pains to examin himſelf, be ignorant of, or miſtaken in, the Condition of his Soul, if this be it. For whoever, will act honeſtly and impartially, ought not to paſs a Sentence of Abſolution on himſelf, upon the bare Performance of ſome relative, or inſtrumental Duties of Religion; but he ought to Inquire, Firſt, What Vertues he Practiſes, which put him upon <hi>Expence, Hazard</hi> or <hi>Travel;</hi> what Works of Piety or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he performs; and what Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they bear to his Ability. Next, he ought to conſider the <hi>Deſign</hi> and <hi>End,</hi> he propoſes to himſelf, in all his Religious Performances; whether he ſeek the Honour of God, the Welfare of Man, and his own Improvement and Growth in Goodneſs, or whether he does this meerly to acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of a task, and diſcharge himſelf of what he takes for granted, as a Duty; though he finds no pleaſure, no advantage in it. Thirdly, he muſt reflect upon the <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> of his Mind, in reference to theſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:29455:234"/>
what hunger and thirſt he has for Righteouſneſs; what Warmth, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, Elevation, or Earneſtneſs of Mind, accompanies his Performances; what Peace, and Pleaſure his Reflection on them; or whether Religion be not a burthen to him, or ſomething to which Cuſtom only reconciles him. Laſtly, he ought to examine what Operation, what <hi>Influence</hi> his Religious Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances have upon him. Prayer, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Reading, and ſuch-like Duties, do naturally tend, to enlighten the Mind, purifie the Heart, increaſe our Love, ſtrengthen our Faith, and confirm our Hope; and therefore, where this is not the Effect of them, we may conclude, that they are not diſcharg'd in that manner, and with that Sincerity, they ought. He therefore that will examin himſelf aright, muſt not ask himſelf how often he reads, how often he hears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then reſt there; but muſt ask himſelf, what <hi>Effect</hi> theſe Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances have had upon his Mind; which he will ſoon diſcern; if he demand of himſelf, what the bent and ſcope of his Life is: how much he advances, and improves in the Conqueſt of any
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:29455:234"/>
Vice, and the Attainment of any Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; what he loves, or what he hates; what Eſteem he has for the Things of God, and what for the things of Men. And in a word, how he follows after Univerſal Righteouſneſs; and how he encreaſes in Purity of Heart, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Lukewarmneſs,</hi> or <hi>Coldneſs,</hi> may be conſider'd more <hi>particularly,</hi> as it diſcovers it ſelf in the Performance of this or that Duty; in Hearing, Reading, Prayer, and Participation of the Lord's Supper. Now 'tis certain, that there is a Deadneſs in theſe Duties, which proceeds from a <hi>carnal,</hi> and <hi>unſanctified</hi> Heart; and is a plain Symptom of a <hi>State of Sin:</hi> And yet it is too common, that they, who are ſubject to it, make little Reflection upon it, and are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concerned for it. On the other hand, many complain of Lifeleſsneſs in Duty, where there is no juſt ground for this Complaint; And this is no ſmall Evil to ſuch; for it diſturbs the Peace of their Minds, damps the Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Alacrity of their Service, and clogs and encumbers their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with needleſs doubts, and Scruples.
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:29455:235"/>
Some have gone about to ſet this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter right very unskilfully; and whilſt they have, as they thought, ſhun'd <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiastick</hi> Raptures, and <hi>irregular</hi> Heate, have really betray'd the Cauſe of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>ſolid Fervency</hi> of <hi>Spirit;</hi> and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of Prayer, and ſuch other Duties in ſuch a manner, as cannot but reflect diſadvantagiouſly on themſelves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſuch, as are moderately vers'd in the Scriptures; and have any Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Power of God's Word, and Spirit, upon their Souls. But what ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes me moſt is, that ſome, of very deſerved Repute, have taught, That the <hi>ſeeking ſpiritual Pleaſure in Prayer,</hi> is an <hi>Enemy</hi> to <hi>Perfection;</hi> That <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Ardor</hi> of Spirit in Prayer, does, often happen to the <hi>weakeſt</hi> Chriſtians; and very ſeldom to the <hi>Perfect.</hi> But my buſineſs not being to combat the Opinions of Men, but to advance Truths in the moſt charitable, and in the moſt effectual manner, that I can; Therefore without taking Notice of the Motives, or Reaſons, which have byaſs'd any on this Subject, I will lay down two or three Propoſitions, which will, I hope,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:29455:235"/>
clear this Matter, and promote the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, I am now carrying on.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, <hi>Lifeleſsneſs,</hi> or Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in theſe Duties, muſt never be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</hi> There is a vaſt Difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>habitual</hi> and <hi>accidental</hi> Coldneſs in Duty; the Former is the Symptom of worldly, carnal, and unregenerate Minds; but not the Latter. Many are the Accidents, which diſturb, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſe the Body; many are the things which diſtract, and clog the Mind; from both which, becauſe we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be utterly free in this World, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Devotion will never be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and uniform; but that it will have its <hi>Interruptions,</hi> and <hi>Allays;</hi> and Dulneſs and Lifeleſsneſs, will ſometimes ſeize upon the beſt of Chriſtians. But then, if this ſpiritual Deadneſs, in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Exerciſes, be <hi>fixt, conſtant,</hi> and <hi>habitual,</hi> it muſt needs be a Proof of a corrupt Mind; For 'tis impoſſible, that there ſhould be a true Principle of Grace within, which ſhould never, or very rarely, ſhew it ſelf in the Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Fervency of our Devotion. How is it poſſible, that that Man, who
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:29455:236"/>
is generally ſlight, and ſuperficial in his Confeſſion, ſhould have a true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction, and ſincere Contrition for Sins? How is it poſſible that he, who is generally indifferent, formal and cold in his Petitions, ſhould have a juſt Senſe, either of his Wants, or Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; or a true Value, for the Grace and Favour of God? The Sum is, Deadneſs in Duty, is either General or Rare, Common or Accidental: If it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls us <hi>Commonly,</hi> 'tis an Argument of an unregenerate Heart; if <hi>Rarely,</hi> 'tis not. But if the Returns of Life and Deadneſs in Duty, be ſo frequent and unconſtant, that 'tis impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin, whether the one or the other, prevail moſt; then 'tis plain, that the State alſo of ſuch a Man is very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Duty muſt never be Deſtitute of <hi>Sincerity,</hi> though it may of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and Tranſport; it muſt never be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Seriouſneſs</hi> and Concernment, though it may be, very defective in the <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Ardency.</hi> Thus in Prayer, the Tenderneſs and Contrition of the Soul, diſſolv'd in
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:29455:236"/>
Love, and Sorrow, is a Frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, much above, what the Penitent commonly arrives at. But an Averſion for Sin, a firm Reſolution to forſake it; and a hearty Deſire to be enabled by the Grace of God, ſo to do, is what he muſt not want. So again, Joy and Tranſport, the Ardor and Exultancy of Mind, is the Effect of a clear Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; an aſſur'd Conſcience; a Heart enflam'd with Love, and a ſtrict Life; Whoever therefore, falls ſhort in the one, will generally fall ſhort in the other too. But every Chriſtian, that is truly ſuch, muſt have a true Senſe of his Wants, a hearty deſire to pleaſe God; a true Notion of his Goodneſs, and a ſteady Dependance upon it tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Chriſt. And theſe things are ſufficient, to unite our Hearts, and our Lips in the ſame Petitions; to make us in earneſt, in all the Duties we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and careful to intend, the main end of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Prayer of the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man, is generally offer'd up, with the <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt</hi> and moſt <hi>exalted</hi> Paſſion; and a holy Pleaſure mingles it ſelf, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:29455:237"/>
part of his Office: his Petitions and Praiſes; his Confeſſions, Deprecations, and Confidences, are all of them, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of warm, and Delightful Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And how can we well conceive it otherwiſe? muſt not thoſe <hi>Praiſes</hi> and <hi>Magnificates,</hi> be full of Joy and Tranſport, which flow from a full Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the Divine Favour, from a long Experience of his Love, and from the glorious Proſpect of a bleſſed Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? can thoſe <hi>Deprecations,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences</hi> want a heavenly Calm, and Tranquility of Spirit, which reſt upon the Mediation of Jeſus, the Promiſes of an immutable God, and the Pledge of his Spirit? can thoſe <hi>Confeſſions</hi> want Contrition, that have all the Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that holy Zeal, and the humbleſt Reflections, can inſpire them with? which are powered forth by a Soul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightn'd, purify'd, ſtrong in the Faith, rooted and grounded in Love, by a Soul conſequently, that has the livelieſt Senſe of the Deformity, and Danger of Sin, of the Beauty and Pleaſure of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, of the infinite Goodneſs of God, and of that Love of Chriſt, that paſſeth Knowledge? Can finally, thoſe <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:29455:237"/>
want Deſire and Flame, which are offer'd up by a Soul, that hungers and thirſts after Righteouſneſs, that counts all things, but dung and droſs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Jeſus, that pants after God, that long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to be diſſolv'd, and to be with Chriſt? And as we may thus, from the Nature of things collect, what kind of Prayers, thoſe of the Perfect Man ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally are; ſo may we, from the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Royal <hi>Pſalmist,</hi> and others, demonſtrate all this, to be no vain Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation; but real Matter of Fact. 'Tis true, <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Gravity</hi> and <hi>Significancy</hi> of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi> are the Characters, moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in <hi>Publick</hi> Offices, in the beſt and moſt ancient Prayers: and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the Lord's Prayer. We find in them, few or no Figures of Speech, no Vehemence of Expreſſion. But it is true too, That the Devotion of a Soul diſengag'd as it were, from the Body, retir'd from the World, collected within it ſelf, raiſed by daily Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and accuſtom'd to Converſe with Heaven, flows naturally, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily. Thoſe great <hi>Ideas,</hi> which ſuch a Prayer as that of our Lord's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:29455:238"/>
preſent to the Mind, inflame the Deſire, awaken all the Paſſions of the Holy Man, without any Labour of Imagination, or Artifice of Words.</p>
               <p>Thus have I conſidered the Nature of Lukewarmneſs; and ſhew'd how far the Perfect Man is remov'd from it. My next buſineſs is, to perſwade and exhort Men to quit it; and become ſincere, and zealous. Only I muſt, Firſt, take notice by the way, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Idleneſs, and Lukewarmneſs, there is ſometimes a Third Cauſe, or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Unfruitfulneſs; which deſerves never to be ſlighted: that is, <hi>Fickleneſs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nsteadineſs,</hi> or <hi>Inconſtancy.</hi> Many there are, who often purpoſe, project, and reſolve great Matters; but never bring forth any Fruit to Perfection: What they Build one day, they throw down another. They put on, as many various moral Forms, as <hi>Proteus</hi> in the Poets does, natural ones; ſometimes they are in a fit of Zeal; at other times, nothing but Coldneſs and bare Form; ſometimes they are in the Camp of Vertue; ſometimes in that of Vice. In a word, they halt, like the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Baal;</hi> and are

divided, and diſtracted, between a <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Duty,</hi> and the <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Body;</hi> between the <hi>Checks</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> on the one hand; and ſome fooliſh <hi>Inclinations</hi> on the other. This State, I have had an Eye too very often, nor ſhall I forget it here; but ſhall propoſe ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for the Cure of Lukewarmneſs, and Formality, as may be alſo of very good uſe to all ſuch, as fall ſhort of the main End of Religion; being not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and thoroughly changed; but are only <hi>almoſt perſwaded to be Chriſtians:</hi> and only not altogether <hi>ſo far from the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> as others. This being premiſed, I proceed, and</p>
               <p n="1">1. I will Enquire into the Cauſes from whence Lukewarmneſs, and all abortive Attempts after Vertue, flow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I will ſhew the <hi>Folly, Guilt,</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> of a Laodicean State.</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. Of the Cauſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are generally Four.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Men finding themſelves under great Difficulties in coming up to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in the true genuine and Goſpel
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:29455:239"/>
Notion of it, have endeavour'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Way, and widen the Gate that leads to Life; and have therefore form'd to themſelves, more ſoft and pliant Notions, of Vice and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: Such as may be more eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated, either to their particular <hi>Inclinations,</hi> or to the <hi>Modes,</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions</hi> of the World, than thoſe of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles can. Hence it is, that amongſt ſuch as pretend, to ſome regard for Religion, Humility, Poverty of Spirit, Self-denial, Abſtinence and Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are ſo far from being viſible in their Practice, that we ſeem to have almoſt loſt the Notion of them. And the Pride of Life, and the Luſt of the Eyes, are ſo univerſally practiſed, that though we know, that theſe in St. <hi>John,</hi> are the Names of Vices, we ſcarce know what the Things themſelves are. We have confounded the Mears and Bounds of Vice and Vertue; and ſuch are the Freedoms, I will now ſay of thoſe who profeſs Debauchery, but Chriſtianity, that if they be conſiſtent with the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity and Purity of the Goſpel, 'twill be hard to determine, what Exceſs is. And in a word, how many are there,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:29455:239"/>
who making a Profeſſion of living by Faith, and looking for the bleſſed Hope, and the glorious Appearance of Chriſt, do yet live, as if all the buſineſs of Life, were to get, and enjoy as much of this World as they can; who profeſſing themſelves the Diſciples of Chriſt, whoſe Heart was lowly, his Fortune mean, and his Appearance humble, do yet lay out their Time, their Labour, their Wealth, on this one Deſign, to make ſuch a ſhew, ſuch a Figure in the World, as may render them the Gaze, and Envy of their Neighbours? And, as our Indulgence to our ſelves in theſe things, which relate to the Pride, and Vanitfy of Life, and the Eaſe and Appetites of the Body, is very great, ſo on the ſame ground, and for the ſame reaſon, is our <hi>Zeal</hi> for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Vertue, and the Honour of God, very little, faint, and remiſs. Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation has very little Savour, very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Grace in it; and we are ſo far, from being reſolute, and induſtrious to awe, or ſhame Vice abroad, that we our ſelves ſhould be almoſt out of Countenance, if we ſhould be obſerv'd to pay any particular Reſpect to Religion or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:29455:240"/>
in Company. The Government of our Families, is ſo lax and eaſie, that it ſavours more of Coldneſs and Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, than Fervency of Spirit. 'Tis true indeed, theſe I am ſpeaking of, do generally frequent the Houſe of God; <hi>and they ſit before him as his People; and delight to hear his Word:</hi> But ſo did the <hi>Jews,</hi> when God tells them, in the Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. <hi>that their hearts went after their Covetouſneſs:</hi> And in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> we have but an odd Character of the Morals of theſe People; of whom, God ſaith, <hi>yet they ſeek me daily, and delight to know my ways:</hi> nay further, <hi>they delight in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to God,</hi> Iſa. 58.2. Now though ſuch, as I am ſpeaking of, may not be guilty to this Degree, ſo as to be chargeable with open Wickedneſs; yet I am very much afraid, that even in this Duty, they but promote the Cheat, and Impoſture they put upon themſelves; and make their Diligence in this point, miniſter to quiet their Conſciences in their Laodicean State; for 'twere eaſie to prove, that ſuch as theſe, do more generally aim at the Entertainment of the Ear, than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:29455:240"/>
of the Heart. And we may ſay of Preachers now, as God did of <hi>Ezekiel; And lo, thou art unto them as a lovely Song, of one that has a very pleaſant Voice,</hi> Ezek. 33.32. the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of the Voice; the Gracefulneſs of Delivery; a Flow of Words; the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of Novelty, and Notion; the Beauty of Sentences; and the Spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Wit and Fancy, or an Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Learning, theſe are, I doubt, too aften the things that draw toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and charm an Auditory: And ſo all are pleaſed, but none converted or edified; for who ſweats or bluſhes, who trembles or grows pale at theſe Sermons? who goes away from them wounded, or ſtruct through, ſerious, and penſive, full of pious Fears, and devout Deſires.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Laodicean State, ſprings from Sloth and Puſillanimity, or the Want of a thorough, and well-grounded Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. This was one Cauſe of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Fluctuation, and Uncertainty; they were indeed, deſirous of a <hi>Canaan,</hi> but were not forward to purchaſe it, by tedious Marches, hazardous Encounters,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:29455:241"/>
and the Hardſhip of Hunger, and Thirſt, and ſuch like: They were ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non willing to have preferr'd, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and Servitude of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with Security and Fulneſs, before a <hi>Canaan</hi> on theſe Tems. And thus it is, this day with Chriſtians of a Laodicean Spirit, and a doubtful, ſtaggering Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance. An Heaven they would have, but would not purchaſe it at too dear a ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e; they would be accounted the Diſciples of Chriſt, and ſhare in the Merits of his Sufferings, but they would not take up his Sufferings, but they would not take up his Croſs, in any ſenſe, and follow him. But alas, <hi>Iſrael</hi> might as well have gained their Liberty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> or a <hi>Canaan,</hi> without Travel and Hardſhip, and Blood, as theſe, Vertue, and Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Watchfulneſs and Induſtry: We may as well hope to-ſupport, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Health and Strength of the Body, without Food or Exerciſe, as that of the Soul, without Meditation, and Prayer: we may as ſoon Conquer our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, without Diſcipline, Expence and Blows, as maſter our Corruptions, and become Vertuous, without ſpiritual Watchfulneſs, Travel, or Contention.
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:29455:241"/>
There is indeed Force and Efficacy enough, in the Word of God, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the Mind, and purifie the Heart; if we would but frequently and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Read, and Meditate it. The Grace of the Spirit is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer our Corruptions, and ſtrengthen, and eſtabliſh us in Faith, and Obedience, if we did but earneſtly and frequently pray for it; and cheriſh and improve it, when obtain'd. The Means, which God has preſcribed, are undoubtedly proper, and ſuitable, powerful, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to the Attainment, Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Increaſe of Holineſs; and all his Ordinances, have a Divine Vertue, and Energy in them, if they be but duly, and conſcienſciouſly made uſe of. But if we do not watch; if we do not meditate; if we do not pray; if we expoſe our ſelves to a vain, and trifling Converſation, if we Indulge the Body, all the Eaſe it is inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to; and put our ſelves upon no Duties; practiſe no Diſcipline, that we have any Reluctancy for, 'tis not to be wonder'd at, if our Vertue be crazy, and ſickly; if our Performances be cold, and unedifying; our Faith weak;
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:29455:242"/>
our Affections low, and grovelling; our Life unſteady, and unprofitable; our Religion deſtitute of true Pleaſure; and our latter End of any rational Comfort, or well-grounded Confidence? 'Tis naturally to be expected, that the Soul of the Sluggard, ſhould be like his Field, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.30. <hi>I went by the Field of the Slothful, and by the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of the Man void of underſtanding; and lo it was all grown over with Thorns; and Nettles had covered the face there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and the stone wall thereof was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down:</hi> this is one plain Cauſe, and commonly the Firſt, of our halting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Baal;</hi> namely our Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Sloth in Religion, joyned with Puſillanimity and Cowardiſe, which moves us to decline all Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and diſables us to make a bold Reſiſtance againſt Temptations: how criminal and guilty, this muſt render us in the ſight of God, 'tis no difficulty to gueſs. Is this the Zeal, the Revenge of an humble, and active Penitent? Is this to redeem the Time, and efface the Memory of our paſt Sins and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations? Is this the Converſation, that becomes the Children of the Light,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:29455:242"/>
and of the Day? Is this our hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs? is this our Ambition, our Paſſion for an Heaven? Finally, is it thus we requite the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Obligations of God, and the Love of Jeſus, that paſſeth Knowledge? ſhall ſuch halting trimming Chriſtians as theſe, think ye, ever be judg'd, endued with a true and living Faith, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it the whole Tenour of their Lives, ſo much Coldneſs, and Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for that Salvation, which the Son of God, thought worth the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing, by ſo much Travel, and ſo much Sorrow, ſo much Shame, and ſo much Blood?</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Third Cauſe of our Halting between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Baal</hi> is ſome Degree of Infidelity. This was the Caſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> too. They were ever prone to Idolatry; partly train'd up to it in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and elſewhere; partly being more capable of forming an <hi>Idea</hi> of a Finite and Topical God, than of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and Univerſal one, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.23. Partly being fond of following the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions of other Nations. And laſtly, mov'd, partly by that great and long
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:29455:243"/>
Proſperity, which <hi>Egypt,</hi> and other Idolatrous Nations enjoy'd: and no doubt, comparing it too, with the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and Uncertainty of their own Fortune and the frequent Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Expectations, <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 2. never laying it to Heart all the while, that the way to ſecure their Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was to change, not their God but their Manners. I would to God, this were not too lively a Deſcription of the State of too many Chriſtians; and that we could not trace our Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs and Fickleneſs in Religion, too plainly back, to the ſame Source or Origine; namely, ſome Degrees of Infidelity. I wiſh the Proſperity of the wicked, do not ſomewhat under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Belief of a Providence: I wiſh whatever we talk of a Treaſure in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World, we do not now and then think it wiſeſt to have our Portion in this. I am afraid, that the Decays and Diſſolutions of our Nature in Death, the Rottenneſs and Corruption of the Grave, and the Variety of Changes and Fortunes, our very Duſt undergoes, may tempt us to ſome Scruples, and Jealouſies about a poſt-humous
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:29455:243"/>
Life. But however it be in theſe points, I am too too well aſſur'd, that we do often doubt, whether Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue be the true Bleſſedneſs of Life; whether there be that Pleaſure in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the Scripture affirms there is. I am confident, the Notions of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, with which the Scripture furniſhes us, are often blur'd and blotted by the Maxims and Cuſtoms of the World: and perſwade my ſelf, that there is ſcarcely one of thoſe, that are Laodiceans and Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers in Religion, that do not flatter themſelves, that God will not be as ſevere as his Threats; and that he will receive them into Heaven, upon mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſofter terms, than the Goſpel propoſes. Some ſuch kind of Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as this, muſt poſſeſs the Heart, where-ever the Life is ſo infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our Profeſſion. When <hi>the Word preached doth not profit,</hi> it is becauſe it is not <hi>mingled</hi> with a due Meaſure of <hi>Faith, in thoſe that hear it.</hi> If we did truly believe the Revelations of God; if we did ſee the Promiſes of God as evident and preſent by Faith, though diſtant in themſelves, 'twere impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:29455:244"/>
but they muſt move, but they muſt take us; 'twere impoſſible, but they muſt enkindle in us another ſort of Deſire, and this Deſire would ſoon produce another ſort of Endeavours, another ſort of Life. When <hi>Moſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held <hi>Canaan</hi> from <hi>Piſga,</hi> how paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately did he deſire to enter into <hi>that</hi> good Land? When the Diſciples had ſeen Jeſus. Aſcend up into Heaven, how were they tranſported with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of following him! how unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was their Joy! how fervent their Prayers! how laſting and enlarged their Gratitude! <hi>they returned to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>with great Joy; and were continually in the Temple, praiſing and bleſſing God.</hi> How does a Proſpect of Gain capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Covetous? How does the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Expectation of Pleaſure, enflame the Voluptuary? how does the Sight of Vanity, and Grandure, infect the proud? and the Hope of Glory fire the Ambitious? What, hath the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Pleaſures of Holineſs, no At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction? has Heaven no Charms in it? has the Favour and Love of God, and of Jeſus no Force, no Power in them? Surely we have not the face to
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:29455:244"/>
deny, but that the Promiſes of God, are great and precious one: and if they raiſe no Paſſion in us, it muſt not be through want of <hi>Excellent</hi> and Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in <hi>them,</hi> but want of <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>us.</hi> And then judge you, how acceptable this kind of Infidelity muſt render us to God; what Value can God have for a People whom no kindneſs can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige, no Arguments convince; with whom, no Miracles can gain Belief; no Aſſurances or Promiſes find Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit? Hell is the portion of the <hi>fearful,</hi> and <hi>unbeliever, Rev.</hi> 21.8. And what dreadful Judgments did overwhelm <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> as often as they thus halted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Idols! It did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them, that they had ſome ſort of <hi>Veneration</hi> for the Memory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his <hi>Miracles;</hi> ſince this was not able to over-rule their <hi>Prejudice,</hi> and <hi>Superſtition;</hi> that they retain ſome Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, for <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and that <hi>God,</hi> which was the <hi>Fear</hi> of their <hi>Fathers;</hi> ſince they had as much, or more, for the <hi>Nations</hi> round about them; and their <hi>Gods</hi> too. And whatever Power they did acknowledge in the God of Heaven; or whatever
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:29455:245"/>
Benefit they did own themſelves to have deriv'd from him, as I can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think, the Memory of either was utterly extinguiſh'd amongſt them, all this avail'd them nothing, while they made their Court to other Gods too; and put their Truſt in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, and Protection. Though this be ſufficient to make us ſenſible of the Guilt of a Laodicean Vertue, and an uncertain halting Faith, yet I muſt advance on, and obſerve unto you a worſe Principle, if worſe can be, of this Deportment yet, which is,</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Fourth Fountain of this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteadineſs and Remiſneſs in Religion is, ſome Remains of Corruption; the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of ſome vicious Paſſion or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Mens Actions, are the plaineſt Indications of their Affections. If the Life looks two ways, we need not doubt, but that the Heart does ſo too. This was that made the young Man in the Goſpel fluctuate ſo between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Mammon;</hi> this was the Caſe of <hi>Herod,</hi> he had yielded, no doubt, to the Power and Force of the <hi>Baptiſts Reaſons;</hi> if he had not
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:29455:245"/>
been drawn back by the Charms of his <hi>Herodias.</hi> And this is the Caſe of every Man, who is but <hi>almoſt</hi> a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; he is under the Aſcendant of ſome ſilly or vile Luſt or other: this is that, which ſpoils the Taſte of the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Manna;</hi> and diminiſheth the Price of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Without doubt, Men would apply themſelves more vigorouſly, to ſpiritual Things, were they not too fond of the Body, and the Pleaſures of it: they would certainly ſeek the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, more earneſtly; and make a better proviſion than they do for the other World, were they not too much taken with this; and therefore too apt to ſet up their Reſt on this ſide <hi>Jordan.</hi> Now if this be ſo, what can we expect; they only who <hi>conquer,</hi> are <hi>crowned;</hi> they that <hi>ſow</hi> to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and to the <hi>world,</hi> can reap nothing from theſe but <hi>Corruption.</hi> Theſe kind of Chriſtians, though peradventure, they are not Slaves to any <hi>infamous</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous</hi> Luſts, are yet entangled by ſome other, not muchleſs injurious, though not to <hi>Reputation,</hi> yet to <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Heart;</hi> they are captived to the World, and Fleſh, though their Chains
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:29455:246"/>
ſeem better poliſhed, and of a finer Metal; they cannot mount upwards, they cannot conquer, being retarded, and kept under, if not by the <hi>Strength</hi> of <hi>Temptation,</hi> yet by their own <hi>Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Weakneſs:</hi> and yet, why ſhould I doubt, but theſe are conquer'd by Temptation? The more <hi>innocent</hi> the Object of any ones Paſſion is, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the more <hi>fatal;</hi> becauſe we are the more apt to <hi>indulge</hi> our ſelves in it. The Cauſes of Lukewarmneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus pointed out, 'tis evident, what the Cure of it conſiſts in, namely, in forming juſt, and correct Notions of Vertue, and Vice; in ſtrengthening, and confirming our Faith; and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, and compleating our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. I will now endeavour to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the Minds of Men, with an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Dread of this State of Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs, by ſhewing,
<list>
                     <item>1. The Folly.</item>
                     <item>2. The Guilt, and</item>
                     <item>3. The Danger of it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Folly. How reaſonably may I here, addreſs my ſelf to the Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:29455:246"/>
in the words of <hi>Elijah</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites; How long halt ye between two Opinions; if the Lord be God, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him; but if</hi> Baal, <hi>then follow him,</hi> 1 King. 18.21. If you do indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that your Safety and Happineſs, depends upon God, then ſerve him in good earneſt: but if you think, this depends upon the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, then ſerve theſe: if you really think, that Vertue and Religion, are the moſt ſolid and ſtable Treaſure, then ſtrive ſincerely and vigorouſly to poſſeſs your ſelves of them: but if you really think, that the Eaſe and Pleaſure of the Body, Reſpect, and Pomp, and State is the proper Portion, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Good of Man, then devote, and offer up your ſelves to theſe. For what a folly is that Life, which will neither procure us the Happineſs of this World, nor of another? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is it, to liſten only ſo much to Conſcience, as to damp and chil our Pleaſure; and ſo much to Pleaſure, as to diſturb the Peace and Repoſe of Conſcience? But indeed, as the Words of <hi>Elijah</hi> were rather an <hi>Irony</hi> than any real Doubt, whether <hi>Baal</hi> or the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:29455:247"/>
Lord were God, rather a ſcornful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion of their Folly, and Stupidity, than a Serious Exhortation to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, whether Idolatry or the Worſhip of the true God, were to be choſen: I doubt not, but mine will ſeem to you, to carry no other Sound in them. The Diſparity is ſo vaſt between God and the World, between Religion and Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, Covetouſneſs or Ambition; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe Hopes and Enjoyments, we may reap from the one, and thoſe we can fancy in the other; that there is no place for doubting, what Choice we are to make, or to which Side we are to adhere: Nay, in this we are more criminal than the <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſelf-condemn'd. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſeem to be at a Loſs, whether the Lord, or <hi>Baal</hi> were God; they doubted under whoſe Protection they might thrive beſt. But at this day, whoever believes a God, knows very well, there is none beſides him. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever paſſion we have for the World, and the Things of it; whatever ſpiritual I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, we are guilty of, our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not yet ſo far corrupted, as to attribute to them, in Reality, any thing
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:29455:247"/>
like Divinity. Whilſt we dote on, Wealth, we at the ſame time know that it makes its ſelf Wings, and flies away: whilſt on Greatneſs, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we know, that 'tis but a piece of empty, and toilſom Pageantry; and often the Subject of Miſery and diſmal Tragedies, not incident to a lower State: whilſt we dote on Pleaſure, we are well aſſur'd, that 'tis diſhonourable and ſhort, and intermixt with Fears, and Shame, and Torment: We know that nothing here below is able to free our State, and Fortune from Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; our Mind from Guilt; the Body from Death, much leſs the whole Man from a miſerable Eternity. In one word, we know that what we admire is Vanity, and what we worſhip is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an Idol. This being ſo, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt no longer on this Topick; for ſince the World bears no Competition with God in our Opinion, though it often rival him in our Affections, we are not to impute the halting of a Laodicean Chriſtian to any Perſwaſion of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence or Alſufficiency; or any thing like Divinity, in the things he dotes on, ſerves and worſhips: but we muſt
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:29455:248"/>
find out ſome other Reaſon of it. And that is generally this, we are willing to believe, that our Fondneſs for the World, and our, Indulgence to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is conſiſtent enough with Religion; That it is no Violation of our Faith, nor Provocation to God; nor conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, Prejudice to our Eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: And then 'tis no wonder, if we blend and compound Religion, and Senſuality; and ſtand divided in our Affections: and conſequently halt in our Service between God and the World. To prevent this I will ſhew.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this is a great <hi>Sin;</hi> which is ſufficiently evident from this Single Conſideration, That it fruſtrates the Efficacy of the Goſpel and the Spirit; and entirely defeats the great Deſign of the Chriſtian Religion. For, 1. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion has no effectual Influence upon the Lukewarm himſelf: the Goſpel works no thorough Change in him. The Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is not converted into a Saint; nor Human Nature perfected by Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Divine one. 2. The Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans can never offer up to God any Gift, any Sacrifice worthy of him;
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:29455:248"/>
nor render him any Service acceptable to him; the <hi>Kingdom of God is Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 14. <hi>He that in theſe things ſerveth Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved of Men.</hi> But alas! theſe Men are almoſt utter Strangers to theſe things; a few, faint, and irreſolute Wiſhes, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and cuſtomary Prayers, nigardly and grumbling Alms, and an Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God's Word, rather out of ſpiritual Wantonneſs, than Devotion, theſe are the Offerings, they can make God; and will God be better pleas'd with theſe, than he was with thoſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that were deform'd with Maims and Blemiſhes, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>offer now theſe to thy Governour: will he he pleaſed with thee, or accept of thy Perſon, ſaith the Lord of Hoſt.</hi> The <hi>Magi</hi> indeed, left their Country, and offer'd <hi>Gold, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe and Myrrh to our Saviour,</hi> Mat. 2. <hi>David</hi> would <hi>not Sacrifice to God of that which coſt him nothing,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 24. The Primitive Chriſtians offered up to God, Prayers, and Tears, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and Travels; Nay their Honours, their Fortunes, their Lives, their Blood. But alas, what have theſe Men to offer?
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:29455:249"/>
they have not Love enough to put them upon any Expence, nor Faith enough, to put them upon any Hardſhips, for the ſake of God, and Vertue. <hi>For though they think themſelves rich and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſed in goods; and to have need of nothing, yet</hi> are they poor, wretched, and miſerable, and blind, and naked, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. And ſhall theſe receive a Crown of Righteouſneſs? ſhall theſe ſhare in the Kingdom of Jeſus? ſhall theſe partake in the Triumph of the Laſt Day, it can never be; they do nothing worthy of the Goſpel, nothing that can entitle them to the Benefit of the Croſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Life of the Laodicean Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will never do any do any Credit to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; or reflect any Honour on the Goſpel. No Man will be ever able to diſcern the Beauty of Holineſs, or the Power and Efficacy of Divine Truths, from the Practiſe and Converſation of ſuch an one. Ah! had the Carriage of the Primitive Times been ſuch as his, I know not what <hi>Miracles</hi> might have done, I am ſure <hi>Examples</hi> would never
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:29455:249"/>
have made many Proſelites. But the Chriſtians then acted thoſe Vertues, which the <hi>Pagan</hi> only pretended to: and Faith in Jeſus atchiev'd thoſe Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries over the World, which the <hi>Jews</hi> (ſo debauch'd and ſtupid were they grown) did in the Declenſion of that State neither underſtand nor pretend to: This was that which made the World admire, and love Chriſtianity. After thus much ſaid of the Effects of this ſort of Carriage; I need ſcarcely put any one in Mind, what will be the laſt and ſaddeſt Effect of it; for if our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity be ſuch, that it neither truly ſets us free from our Bondage to the World and Fleſh; nor enrich our Soul with true and ſolid Vertues; if it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promote the Honour of God, nor the Good of Man, it muſt unavoidably follow that having no true Title to God's Favour, nor any rational Ground, on which to build an Aſſurance of it, we can reap no true Comfort or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from Religion here, nor any Reward from it hereafter. Alas! what talk I of Comfort and Reward? <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and Anguiſh muſt take hold of the Sinners in</hi> Sion; <hi>and Fearfulneſs muſt
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:29455:250"/>
ſuprize the Hypocrite:</hi> And from the Troubles and Miſeries of <hi>thu</hi> Life, they muſt go down into the Everlaſting Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>another.</hi> The Scripture is plain; God will ſpue them out of his Mouth, as he did the <hi>Laodicean:</hi> He will ſhut the <hi>Gate</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> againſt them, as againſt the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> that had no <hi>Oyl</hi> in their <hi>Lamps:</hi> And their Hell will have one Torment in it, which is incident to no others, that they had once the Hopes of Heaven; and it is no ſmall Aggravation of Miſery to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, even from the Expectation of Happineſs.</p>
               <p>This is not, as I obſerved above to be apply'd to accidental Dulneſs or Deadneſs in Duty; nor are the Decays or Abatements of Love, which good Men ſomtimes ſuffer, immediately to be pronounced damnable. But yet <hi>theſe</hi> are to be put in Mind of the Danger they are in; and recall'd to their former Zeal, in the Words of the Spirit to the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Nevertheleſs, I have ſomewhat againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy first Love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen; and repent, and do the firſt
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:29455:250"/>
Works; or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will remote thy Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick out of his place, except thou repent,</hi> Rev. 2.4, 5.</p>

               <p>I Am arriv'd at the <hi>laſt Stage</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> which I chuſe to call a State of <hi>Zeal;</hi> not only becauſe the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> ſeems to direct me to this Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but alſo becauſe, it ſeems to me, more full and proper than others, that <hi>may</hi> be, or <hi>are</hi> made uſe of, for the ſame End. A State of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that better ſuits <hi>another</hi> Life that <hi>this.</hi> For the Leſſon, the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man is ever and anon to revolve in his Mind is, That the preſent Life is a Life of Labour, and Travel, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings;
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:29455:251"/>
the future one, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and Crowns, and Enjoyments. Then as to that other Expreſſion, the State of <hi>Love,</hi> it ſuits my purpoſe well enough; but does not come up ſo juſtly and exactly to it, as the State of <hi>Zeal;</hi> for I take <hi>Zeal</hi> to be <hi>Love,</hi> in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Elevation and Vivacity, that it is capable of.</p>
               <p>And now, what a noble, what a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Argument,</hi> am I entering upon? Methinks, I feel my Soul grow <hi>warm,</hi> and <hi>enkindle</hi> upon my approaching it; and my firſt Views, or contemplations of it, inſpire me with Deſires of the ſame Nature, with it ſelf. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to ſee my ſelf, confin'd and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, by the Laws of <hi>Method;</hi> and find my ſelf inclin'd to wiſh, That I were now to write, rather a juſt <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,</hi> than a few <hi>Pages.</hi> Here the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick <hi>Acts,</hi> or what is more, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick <hi>Lives</hi> of Saints, Martyrs and Confeſſors, preſent themſelves to my Thoughts: Here <hi>Human</hi> Nature, enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, adorned, and elevated to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Degree, by a Participation of the <hi>Divine</hi> one; Here the Power of <hi>God's Word,</hi> the Energy of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi>
                  <pb n="491" facs="tcp:29455:251"/>
the Triumphs of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the Exſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of <hi>Love,</hi> would be deſcribed; Here the different Excellencies of different <hi>Vertues,</hi> and the different Value of <hi>good Works</hi> ſhould be ſtated and ſetled, and the various Paths, in which, Men purſue the <hi>Heights</hi> of Vertue; and the nobleſt Deſigns be examin'd, and ſolid Piety and true Wiſdom be refin'd, from the Alloys and Mixtures of Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm, Superſtition, Fancy, or whatever elſe they are disfigur'd, and debas'd by. But this cannot <hi>now</hi> be done, and it may be it could not at all be done by <hi>me:</hi> No Meaſure of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, below that with which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were inſpir'd, is ſufficient to treat this Argument, as it requires. Beſides, according to my Capacity, I have been all along making this point. When, in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Section, I ſtated the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Perfection,</hi> ſhew'd by what <hi>Steps</hi> we advanced to it, what <hi>Means</hi> we are to make uſe of, and what would be the <hi>Fruit</hi> of it, I did in Effect deſcribe to my Reader, the State of <hi>Zeal,</hi> and mark'd out the Path that leads to it. When, in the <hi>Second,</hi> I labour to eſtabliſh the true <hi>Liberty</hi>
                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:29455:252"/>
of Man, upon the Overthrow, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation not only of <hi>Mortal Sin,</hi> and of <hi>Idleneſs</hi> and <hi>Lukewarmneſs,</hi> but alſo, as far as it might be, even of <hi>Sin of Infirmity,</hi> and <hi>Original Corruption,</hi> what elſe was I doing, but proſecuting this one Deſigne, namely, the implanting, and propagating in the World, the State of <hi>Zeal?</hi> However, ſomething there ſeems to me yet wanting, to <hi>compleat</hi> my Undertaking; and <hi>that</hi> I am to endeavour now. To which End I will here diſcourſe of three Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What it is in general I mean by <hi>Zeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What is that <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts. And</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of the <hi>Efficacy</hi> or <hi>Force</hi> of this <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as it exerts it ſelf in <hi>good Works.</hi> Of theſe the <hi>two Former</hi> ſhall be the Argument of <hi>this;</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> of the <hi>following</hi> Chapter.</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. of <hi>Zeal</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> what it is. I do not exclude, ſome Degrees of <hi>Zeal,</hi> from every Period of the Chriſtian's
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:29455:252"/>
Life; Sincerity cannot ſubſiſt wholly without it. <hi>The Hunger and Thirst after Righteouſneſs,</hi> which is the ſubject of one of our Saviour's <hi>Beatitudes,</hi> muſt be more or leſs in every Child of God. But it may ſignifie one thing in the <hi>Infant,</hi> another in the <hi>Adult</hi> Chriſtian; in the one, the Conqueſt of Sin, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the Reliques and Remains of former ſinful Habits, and the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of habitual Goodneſs is the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of this <hi>Hunger and Thirſt:</hi> In the other it imports, a vehement Deſire of whatever is yet wanting to a further Accompliſhment, and Conſummation of Righteouſneſs <hi>already</hi> fix't and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd; the entire and ultimate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it in <hi>Heaven;</hi> and in the <hi>mean</hi> Time, the promoting the Divine Glory upon <hi>Earth,</hi> whatever it coſt him to do ſo. By a State of <hi>Zeal</hi> then, I here mean Vertue or Holineſs, not in the bud, or in the bloſſom, but in its full Strength and Stature, grown up, and ripe, and loaded with bleſſed Fruits: I mean <hi>that</hi> Holineſs that is the Reſult of Illumination, or Clearneſs of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the Strength and Force of Holy Reſolution, and the Vigour and
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:29455:253"/>
Energy of Holy Paſſions. In a word, I mean that folie, ſpiritual, and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Religion, which may be felt and enjoy'd by us our ſelves, in the Sereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Tranquility of Conſcience, the Longings and Breathings of Pious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, the Joys and Pleaſures of a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Aſſurance; diſcern'd by the World, in our Lives and Actions, in the Modeſty of our Garb, in the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Humility of all things elſe, that pertain to the <hi>Port</hi> of Life, in the Temperance of our Meals, the Purity and Heavenlineſs of Converſation, the Moderation of our Deſigns and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Inſtruction of our Families, with a tender and undefatigable Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs over them, the Conſtancy of our Attendance <hi>upon,</hi> and the Devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Deportment <hi>in,</hi> the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip of God; and finally, in the Activity, and Generoſity of our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; Or, to ſpeak my Thoughts in the Language of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> a State of <hi>Zeal</hi> is that Perfection or Maturity of Holineſs, which abounds <hi>in the Work of Faith, the Labour of Love, and the Patience of Hope, in our Lord Jeſus Christ, in the ſight of God, and our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                  <pb n="495" facs="tcp:29455:253"/>
1 Theſſ. 1.3. Now the end of all this is, the advancing the Glory of God: and therefore <hi>Zeal</hi> is well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough deſcrib'd, or defin'd, by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or vehement Deſire of doing ſo. Now this is advanced two Ways: <hi>Firſt,</hi> by our <hi>Perſonal</hi> and <hi>Inherent Holineſs:</hi> And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> by the Fruit of it, <hi>good Works.</hi> Of both which, I will now ſpeak a little more particularly.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Of that <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> which conſtitutes the State of <hi>Zeal.</hi> Here I will Enquire into <hi>two</hi> Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man, muſt be poſſeſſed of <hi>all</hi> the Treaſures of Goodneſs: Whether he muſt be adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Confluence, and an Accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>all</hi> Vertues.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What <hi>Height</hi> of Vertue, what <hi>Degree</hi> of Holineſs, he may be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to arrive at.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>Extent</hi> of Righteouſneſs. It is generally thought, That Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality, is as eſſential and neceſſary a
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:29455:254"/>
Property of Goſpel Righteouſneſs, as Sincerity, and Perſeverance; That there is an inſeparable Connexion and Union, between <hi>all</hi> Chriſtian Vertues, ſo that he who wants <hi>any,</hi> muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, to have <hi>none:</hi> This <hi>want</hi> being, not like a Blemiſh that diminiſhes the Beauty, or a Maim that weakens the Strength, but like a Wound that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, the Frame and Contexture, of the Natural Body. This Opinion is partly built upon <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which tells us, That there is a native Luſtre and Beauty in all Vertues; and therefore, there is no one in the whole Syſteme of Morality, but muſt be lovely and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a good Man. Partly, upon <hi>Scripture,</hi> in which, we find the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian repreſented <hi>as holy in all manner of Converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15. <hi>perfect in every good work,</hi> Heb. 13.21. <hi>as fill'd with all the Fulneſs of God,</hi> Eph. 3.19. <hi>as fruitful in every good work, Col.</hi> 1.10. and exhorted, in the moſt comprehenſive Terms imaginable, to the Practice of <hi>every</hi> Vertue. <hi>Finally, Brethren, whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honest, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:29455:254"/>
pure, whatſoever things are lovely, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are of good report, if there be any Vertue, and if there be any praiſe, think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> theſe things.</hi> To which may be added numerous Texts, importing, That Faith is a Principle of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Righteouſneſs; and That the Fear and Love of God, do equally oblige us to <hi>all</hi> his Commandments; and That the Violation, of <hi>one,</hi> involves us in the Guilt of <hi>all.</hi> And the reſult of all this ſeems to be plainly this, That the whole <hi>Chain</hi> of Graces is diſſolved and loſt, if there be but one <hi>Link</hi> wanting. But at this rate, as the <hi>Sincere</hi> Man muſt be endow'd with <hi>all</hi> manner of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ſo muſt the <hi>Perfect excel</hi> in all: But the one and the other Aſſertion. If we conſider things cloſely, ſeems to have in them inſuperable Difficulties, There is a vaſt <hi>Variety</hi> in the Natures of Men, in the States and Conditions of Life, and in the kinds and Degrees, as well of the Sanctifying, as of the Miraculous Gifts of God. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>every Man has his proper Gift of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.7. From whence it ſeems naturally to be inferr'd, That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man is not capable of attaining
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:29455:255"/>
to an Excellence and Eminence in <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Vertue. Experience tells us, That there are different kinds of <hi>Natures,</hi> as well as <hi>Soils;</hi> and that ſome kinds of <hi>Vertues,</hi> like ſome kinds of <hi>Seed,</hi> will thrive better in <hi>one</hi> than in <hi>another.</hi> Nor does <hi>Grace</hi> alter the Matter much; ſince it generally accommodates it ſelf to <hi>Nature.</hi> Laſtly, it ſeems very hard, That every Man ſhould have the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of all Men, of all States, of all Capacities; every particular Member, the Vertues of the whole Church; the Beauty and Strength of the Church, as well as of the natural Body, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, conſiſting, not in the All-ſufficieney of every Member, but in that Variety of Gifts and Graces, that cements and unites, enriches, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the whole. To come up to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Fact;</hi> I read of the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the <hi>Meekneſs</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Patience</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> the <hi>Zeal</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the <hi>Labours</hi> and <hi>Travels</hi> of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> which Firmneſs and Conſtancy is too mean a Name for. Theſe Vertues ſeem therefore, to have been the <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi> Excellencies of theſe Perſons; and
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:29455:255"/>
to have ſhone in <hi>them</hi> with more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant Luſtre, than any <hi>other:</hi> Theſe ſeem to have been the Vertues, for which Grace and Nature eminently qualified them; and to which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, more immediately, and directly, called them. All this conſider'd, ſeems it not enough, to come up to the <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>theſe</hi> great Men? may it not ſuffice, to excel in theſe Vertues, which Nature, Grace, and Providence preſcrib'd? may not the <hi>Perfect</hi> be allow'd to want, what he does not need; would one not think, that, in many Reſpects, it were enough for him to be free from this or that Vice, rather than to expect that he ſhould be adorn'd with this or that Vertue, which he has no uſe for? Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, if by Vertue, we underſtand ſtrictly, ſuch a Habit as enables us to act eaſily, and delightfully. To ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt this Matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Perfect</hi> Man muſt, as I have proved before, not only be ſet free from the Dominion of Sin, but alſo abſtain even from a ſingle Act of preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wickedneſs: he muſt neither Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:29455:256"/>
                  <hi>omit</hi> a Duty, nor Deliberately <hi>commit</hi> any thing repugnant to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, He muſt be endowed with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Wiſdom and Underſtanding, with Faith, Hope, Charity, with the Graces which I will call <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> becauſe neceſſary, and indiſpenſable to all as Chriſtians, abſtracting from their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Capacities and Relations; and <hi>that</hi> too, in an <hi>eminent</hi> Degree; ſo as to be <hi>ſtrong in the Grace which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.1. This will render him <hi>holy in all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: and thoroughly furniſh'd to all good Works.</hi> Theſe two things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Righteouſneſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man, and fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Texts alledg'd. Or if <hi>not,</hi> what follows <hi>will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. He muſt excel in thoſe Vertues, which are moſt <hi>Natural.</hi> I call thoſe Vertues <hi>Natural,</hi> to which Grace and Nature, moſt powerfully diſpoſe, and incline him; for <hi>theſe</hi> he ſeems to be deſign'd by God; theſe will ſoon grow up to Maturity; and much will be their Fruit, and great their Beauty. I do
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:29455:256"/>
not all this while ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> Man, ought not ſo far to ſubdue, and rectifie his Temper, as not only to overcome the Sin of this <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> but in ſome Degrees, poſſeſs the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that is moſt repugnant to it. But to expect him to be eminent <hi>here,</hi> is, I doubt, too hard and unreaſonable. For <hi>here,</hi> when he has beſtowed much Pains and Travel, much Care and Coſt, his Progreſs may not be ſo much, as where he beſtowed <hi>leaſt.</hi> But here I muſt add <hi>two</hi> Cautions; the <hi>one</hi> is, That no Man miſtake contracted <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits</hi> for <hi>Nature,</hi> and then conclude, that it will be impoſſible for him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Perfection</hi> of this or that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, through a natural Incapacity. In the <hi>next</hi> place, let no Man ſatisfie, and content himſelf, in a weak and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect State of <hi>that</hi> Vertue, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſed to the Sin of his <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;</hi> but let him think, that <hi>here,</hi> if any where, his Vertue muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>growing;</hi> and let him not doubt, but that our Saviour's Promiſe, as far as it can be accompliſh'd on Earth, belongs to his ſincere Endeavours here; <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that hunger and thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

The <hi>Perfect</hi> Man muſt be eminent in thoſe Vertues, which are moſt <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary:</hi> Such are thoſe, which his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Station and Calling, or any other Diſpenſation of Providence, he is under, requires of him. Whatever Vertues may be more <hi>delightful,</hi> theſe are more <hi>important;</hi> others may be more <hi>natural,</hi> theſe have more or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> and more of <hi>Merit.</hi> A Man may fall ſhort of <hi>Perfection</hi> in others, without either <hi>Diſparagement,</hi> or <hi>Guilt;</hi> but Deficiency in theſe, can hardly eſcape <hi>both.</hi> Beſides, every thing is lovely it its <hi>place,</hi> and in its <hi>time.</hi> There is a <hi>peculiar</hi> Grace and Luſtre, that attends the Vertues of a Man's <hi>Station,</hi> that is ſcarcely to be found in any other. I would therefore, have my <hi>Perfect</hi> Man, truely great in his <hi>own</hi> Buſineſs; and ſhine with a dazling Luſtre in his <hi>own</hi> Sphere. To this purpoſe, ſurely, ſpeaks the Advice of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. <hi>Having then Gifts, differing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Grace that is given to us, whether Prophecy, let us Prophecy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to the proportion of Faith: or miniſtery, let us wait on our miniſtring: or he that teacheth on teaching: or he that exhorteth, on Exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with Simplicity: he that ruleth, with Diligence: he that ſheweth Mercy, with Chearfulneſs.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, as there is a different <hi>Guilt</hi> in Sins, ſo there is different <hi>Merit</hi> in Vertues: as amongſt Miraculous, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſanctifying Gifts, ſome are more <hi>excellent</hi> than others; and he is the <hi>moſt Perfect Man,</hi> who is enrich'd with the <hi>most Perfect Gifts.</hi> The three Heroick Vertues of the Goſpel are, <hi>Faith, Love, Humility.</hi> Nor do I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly, contrary to the Apoſtle, exclude <hi>Hope;</hi> but comprehend it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Faith.</hi> Of <hi>Faith</hi> I have often had occaſion to ſpeak. <hi>Humility</hi> will make the <hi>laſt</hi> Chapter of <hi>this</hi> Section; and therefore, I will only exhort to <hi>Love. Love</hi> is the nobleſt Fruit of Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Faith, the true Source and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Joy and Peace. <hi>Love</hi> is the moſt pregnant Seed of a Divine Life; 'tis the Principle that animates, moves, and forms the whole Body of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:29455:258"/>
                  <hi>Love</hi> is the bond of Union, and <hi>Communion with the Father and his Son Jeſus</hi> through the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And 'tis but fit, that what renders as moſt <hi>like</hi> God, ſhould render us moſt <hi>dear</hi> to him too: and this <hi>Love</hi> does; <hi>for God is Love.</hi> In ſhort <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law;</hi> 'tis the Beauty and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Diſciple of Jeſus; and the great Subject of Praiſe and Glory in the Day of Judgment. <hi>Love</hi> is the laſt Round in the Scale of <hi>Perfection;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my <hi>Perfect</hi> Man, muſt abound in this. What Degrees of <hi>Love of Deſire,</hi> or <hi>Complacency</hi> for the things of this <hi>preſent</hi> Life, may conſiſt with Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, what with <hi>Perfection,</hi> may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily learn't from ſeveral parts of this Work. There is no doubt but the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> Man, muſt <hi>love God</hi> to that <hi>Degree,</hi> that he muſt always cleave to him, walk as always before him, ever medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and contemplate on Him, and his Works; contrive and ſtudy, labour and contend to pleaſe Him: It muſt be an Affliction to him to be divided from Him but for a little while; and he muſt ever and anon, by Day and Night, break out into his Praiſes, and rejoyce
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:29455:258"/>
and Glory in him. 2. He muſt love God to that Degree, as that all things, in Compariſon of Him, muſt appear blaſted and wither'd, empty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, without Pleaſure, without Beauty: And conſequently, he muſt ſo thirſt after the <hi>Beatifick Viſion,</hi> after the Preſence and Fruition of God, that he muſt earneſtly <hi>deſire to be diſſolv'd,</hi> and pant, and long to be diſmiſſed from the <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> of this <hi>World,</hi> and from the corruptible <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of the <hi>Body.</hi> Nor do I, Laſtly, doubt, but that this <hi>Love</hi> is often ſenſibly <hi>tranſporting:</hi> 'tis a fire within, that ſtrives to break out, and exert it ſelf in the Fruitions of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: 'tis a rich and mighty Cordial, that raiſes Nature above it ſelf, and makes it all Purity, all Glory.</p>
               <p>Thus have I conſider'd, the <hi>Extent</hi> or Compaſs of the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man's <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi> And the <hi>Sum total</hi> is: In ſome he muſt excell, becauſe Natural and Eaſie; in others, becauſe neceſſary. Univerſal ones he <hi>cannot</hi> want; they are eſſential to Chriſtianity; others, of a peculiar Nature, he <hi>may,</hi> unleſs his Circumſtances exact them: Nor is this any Diminutton of his <hi>Perfection.</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:29455:259"/>
Fortitude, Moderation, Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the Vertues of Earth, not Heaven; and yet, none thinks, the bleſſed Inhabitants of that Place Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, becauſe not endow'd with Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits which they do not want. Above all, he that will be <hi>Perfect,</hi> muſt abound in thoſe Graces, which are of the moſt <hi>Heroick</hi> Nature; Faith, Love, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: For theſe are they, which moſt effectually exalt Man above <hi>himſelf,</hi> and above the <hi>World;</hi> which inflame him with a <hi>Zeal</hi> for the Honour of God, and the Good of Man; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to ſurmount the Difficulties, which he meets with, in proſecuting this Glorious Deſign. I am next to Enquire,</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. To what <hi>Height,</hi> to what <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> of Vertue, the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man may advance. I have in part anticipated this Enquiry already; yet cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear adding here <hi>two</hi> Obſervations. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Reaſon and Scripture ſeem to preſs us on towards an endleſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in Vertue. And yet, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That both ſeem to propoſe to us, ſuch a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Perfection</hi> as attainable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which, we cannot go; that ſo the
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:29455:259"/>
                  <hi>Beginner</hi> may not <hi>diſpair</hi> of Perfection, nor the <hi>Perfect abate</hi> any thing of their Vigilance, and their Induſtry. Such a Degree of Excellence, to which nothing can be added; ſuch a Height, above which, there is no room to ſoar, if apply'd to Man, and this World, is ſurely but an Imaginary Notion. To dream of <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>Perfection,</hi> were to forget our Nature, and our State: no Sagacity of Judgment, no Strength of Reſolution, no Felicity of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, can ever advance us to <hi>this</hi> Height. Such a <hi>Perfection</hi> as this, that is incapable of any Increaſe, belongs, I believe, to <hi>God</hi> alone: or if we may allow it to <hi>Angels,</hi> we muſt certainly deny it to <hi>Man:</hi> In <hi>whom,</hi> one would think, the Appetites of the Body can never be ſo entrely ſubdued, that there ſhould be no place to extend his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, or render his Victory more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and compleat: and in <hi>whom,</hi> one would think, the Spirit of God ſhould never reſide in that Meaſure, that there ſhould be nothing to be added to his Fulneſs. 'Tis hard to conceive, how we ſhould ſtudy the Syſteme of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith, how we ſhould daily reflect
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:29455:260"/>
upon our Lives and Actions, without <hi>growing</hi> in ſpiritual Wiſdom and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; 'Tis hard to conceive, how we ſhould give God, the World, and our ſelves, repeated Proofs of our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity in the day of Tryal, without <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing</hi> our Strength and Aſſurance: and Love muſt naturally increaſe with theſe. Whence it is, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging himſelf not yet <hi>Perfect,</hi> reſolves, <hi>that forgetting thoſe things that are behind, and reaching forwards to thoſe things that are before, he would preſs on towards the Mark, for the prize of the high Calling of God, in Christ Jeſus.</hi> Phil. 3.13, 14. And St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> reſolves, <hi>pleniſſima Charitas, quam diu hîc homo vivit, eſt in Nemine; an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Plenitude of Charity is in no Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal upon Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet, if we come to <hi>Fact</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> one would be tempted to think, that the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of our Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, had arrived at that State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their buſineſs was not to climb higher, but rather to make good the Ground they had gain'd. What could render St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Victory over the Body more compleat, who aſſures us, <hi>I am cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:29455:260"/>
with Christ?</hi> And again, <hi>I am crucified to the World, and the World is crucified to me?</hi> What could render the Authority and Dominion of <hi>his</hi> Mind more abſolute, or its Graces more conſummate, and entire? who could ſay with Truth, <hi>'tis not I who live, but Christ who lives in me.</hi> What would you have <hi>added</hi> to that Faith, and Love, which made <hi>him</hi> ready, <hi>not only to be bound, but to die at Jeruſalem,</hi> which made <hi>him long to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt?</hi> As to <hi>thoſe</hi> words of <hi>his,</hi> Phil. 3.13. <hi>forgetting thoſe things that are behind, and reaching forwards,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they</hi> relate to his Tryals and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, to his Perils and Conflicts, not to his Attainments: he does not here deny himſelf to be <hi>Perfect,</hi> though that might well enough have become his Modeſty, and Humility; but only, that he was not to look upon himſelf as already at his Goal, a Conqueror and Crown'd; there being much yet behind to do and ſuffer, notwithſtanding all that he had paſſed through. This is the Senſe of his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we render, <hi>not as though I were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perfect.</hi> As to St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> I am
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:29455:261"/>
of his Mind; for he ſpeaks <hi>Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> and does in effect no more than affirm, That no Man living is as <hi>Perfect</hi> in <hi>this</hi> World, as he will be in <hi>another,</hi> which no Man ſure can ever doubt. —If we conſult <hi>Reaſon,</hi> will it not be apt to tell us, That as every <hi>Being</hi> has its <hi>Bounds</hi> ſet it, ſo has every <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> too? That there is a <hi>Stature,</hi> as of the <hi>Natural,</hi> ſo of the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Man, beyond which it cannot grow? That as to <hi>Grace,</hi> no more can be infuſed, than our <hi>Natures</hi> are capable of? Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, like too rich a Cordial, it will not ſtrengthen, but fire our Natures; or like too dazling a Light, it will not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, but oppreſs our Faculties. And does not the <hi>Parable</hi> of our <hi>Maſter</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance this, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.2. wherein he tells us, That God gave to one, five Talents, to another, two, to another, one, to every Man according to his <hi>Ability.</hi> By which one would think our Lord inſinuates, That the Meaſures of <hi>Grace</hi> are uſually diſtributed in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi> to the Capacities of <hi>Nature;</hi> and that <hi>he</hi> who improved his <hi>two</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents into <hi>four,</hi> arriv'd at <hi>his</hi> proper <hi>Perfection,</hi> as well as <hi>he,</hi> who improv'd
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:29455:261"/>
his <hi>five</hi> into <hi>ten;</hi> it being as abſurd to expect, That the <hi>Perfection</hi> of every Man ſhould be the ſame, as to expect, that all Mens <hi>Bodies</hi> ſhould be of the ſame Height, or their <hi>Minds</hi> of the ſame Capacity.</p>
               <p>Reflecting on all this together, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be of Opinion, That ſome have actually arriv'd at <hi>that</hi> ſtrength of Faith, at <hi>that</hi> ardour of Love, that they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been uncapable of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable <hi>Acceſſions</hi> in <hi>this</hi> Life. But yet, new occaſions may ſtill demand new Vertues; which were indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contained and included in Faith, and Love; but no otherwiſe, than as Fruits and Trees are in their Seeds. And ſome Degree of Original Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may ſtill be lurking in the moſt ſanctified Nature; and ſome Venial De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Imperfections or other, may ſtill leave room, for the greateſt of Saints to extend his Conqueſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, 'tis hard to determine or fix the Bounds of Knowledge, and every new Degree of Light ſeems to make way for more. So that after all, nothing hinders, but that the <hi>Path of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Man,</hi> may, as well with reſpect to
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:29455:262"/>
his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> as his <hi>Fortunes,</hi> be <hi>like the ſhining Light, which ſhineth more and more unto the Perfect day;</hi> I mean, the Day of a bleſſed Eternity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Motives</hi> to <hi>Perfection,</hi> the <hi>Fruit</hi> of it, the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi> of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, laid down in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Section, will all ſerve here: therefore I have nothing to offer of <hi>this</hi> ſort; only, if I forgot to pay that Deference to the <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> of <hi>our Church,</hi> which they juſtly deſerve, I do it <hi>now:</hi> and do ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly perſwade my <hi>Reader,</hi> to a ſtrict Obſervance of them. I do not only think <hi>this</hi> neceſſary to maintain a <hi>Face</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> amongſt us, but alſo, highly conducive to true <hi>Perfection.</hi> I am fully ſatisfied, That there is a <hi>peculiar</hi> Preſence of God in his <hi>publick</hi> Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; That the Devotion of good Men does mutually inflame and enkindle one another; That there is a holy Awe and Reverence ſeizes the Minds of good Men, when they draw near to God in publick Worſhip; And finally, That if the <hi>Offices</hi> of our <hi>Liturgy</hi> do not affect our <hi>Hearts,</hi> 'tis becauſe, <hi>they</hi> are very much indiſpoſed, and very poorly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified

and Glory is the Portion, not of Knowledge, but Patience and Charity; not of an Orthodox Belief and Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pretention, but of Righteouſneſs and Zeal: for the <hi>incorruptible,</hi> the <hi>never-fading Crown,</hi> is <hi>a Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> Or if Men will be judg'd by their <hi>Faith,</hi> which is not the Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> this does not alter the Matter at all: Since <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf will be judg'd by its <hi>Works.</hi> And as a happy <hi>Eternity</hi> depends upon our <hi>Zeal,</hi> ſo nothing elſe can give us any comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, any rational Aſſurance of it in <hi>this</hi> Life.

Emulation: 'tis <hi>Zeal</hi> that baffles all Objections, refutes all Calumnies, and vanquiſhes all Oppoſitions raiſed againſt Religion, and oppreſſes its Enemies with Shame and Confuſion.

But I have ſaid enough: And from what I have
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:29455:268"/>
ſaid the Truth of my <hi>Third</hi> Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion naturally appears.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Viz.</hi> That <hi>Zeal</hi> miniſters moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to the Glory of God. For if <hi>Zeal</hi> be in it ſelf thus lovely, thus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; if the Fruits and Effects of it be thus ſerviceable to the Temporal and Eternal Intereſt of Man: what a Lovely, what an agreeable Notion of God ſhall we form from this one Conſideration of him, That he is the great Author of it? That he, is the Origine and Fountain of that Light and Heat, of that Strength and Power of which 'tis compounded and conſtituted? He commands and exacts it; he excites and encourages to it by the Promiſe of an Eternal Crown, and the raviſhing Fruition of himſelf: he has planted the Seeds of it in our Nature, and he cheriſhes them by the bleſſed and vigorous Influences of his Word and Spirit. How graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is the Divine <hi>Nature!</hi> how graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is the Divine <hi>Government!</hi> when the Subſtance of his Laws is, that we ſhould love as Brethren, that we ſhould cloath the naked, feed the hungry, deliver the captive, inſtruct the fooliſh,

comfort the afflicted, forgive one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if need be, ſeven times a day; and ſuch like.

In a word, the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of <hi>his</hi> Children and Servants, is a Demonſtration of the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himſelf: and in this conſiſts the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Luſtre of Divine Glory.

be ſeparated from the Notion of <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Laſtly as to <hi>Power,</hi> this muſt needs be compriſed in it too: for <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,</hi> which is at leaſt one great branch of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> muſt unavoidably imply <hi>Power</hi> in the <hi>Benefactor</hi> and <hi>Impotence</hi> and <hi>Want</hi> in the <hi>Beneficiary.</hi> And this is the Notion wherein <hi>Holineſs,</hi> when aſcribed to God in Scripture, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken. <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hoſts: Heaven and Earth are full of thy Glory</hi> does expreſs the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Majeſty, as well as the Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Purity, of the Divine Nature: and to <hi>ſanctifie the Lord God in our Hearts</hi> is, in the Language of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not only to love him for his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but revere and fear him for his Majeſty and Greatneſs.

That I can never think that Man can ever riſe to a more eminent Height than <hi>that</hi> to which the Imitation of this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſt will advance him. The more <hi>Perfect</hi> therefore Man is, the more <hi>humble</hi> muſt he be too: The clearer
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:29455:270"/>
View, and the more aſſured Hope he has of Heaven, the more unconcerned muſt he be for all thoſe things which the World pays a Reſpect and Honour to, the more he muſt be above them: The more fervent his Love of God and his Neighbour grows, the more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently muſt he place all his Glory in this one thing, the Conformity of his Affections and Life to that of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus. Then is he <hi>Perfect;</hi> and <hi>the ſame Mind is in him that was in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Finally, the more he <hi>knows</hi> God, the nearer he is admitted into <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with him; the more plainly will he diſcern at how infinite Diſtance he ſtands from the Divine Majeſty and Purity, and will proſtrate himſelf even into <hi>Duſt and Aſhes</hi> before him. The <hi>Perfect</hi> Man admires, adores, obeys, loves, relies, truſts, and reſigns up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and all that is dear to him to God. He is nothing in his own Eyes; he pretends to nothing, he lays Claim to nothing on any other Title than that of the Goodneſs and Bounty of God. Whatever Vertues he has, he aſcribes them to the Grace of God: and the Glory and Immortality he expects, he
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:29455:271"/>
expects only as the <hi>Gift of God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> And whatever he be in <hi>himſelf,</hi> he compares no him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with <hi>others,</hi> but he proves his <hi>own Work,</hi> that he may <hi>have Rejoycing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone, and not in another.</hi> Nothing but <hi>Zeal</hi> for God or <hi>Charity</hi> for Man can put him upon the aſſerting his own Merit or Service: but when glories, it is like St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his <hi>Infirmities;</hi> that <hi>the Power of Chriſt may reſt upon him.</hi>

               <p>Need I here inſiſt on the <hi>Fruit</hi> of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility? Surely 'tis conſpicuous to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that thinks at all. Great is the Peace and Reſt of the <hi>humble</hi> Soul <hi>here</hi>; and great will be his Glory <hi>hereafter.</hi> He who loves not the World nor the things of it, <hi>the Lust of the Feſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life,</hi> enjoys a perpetual Calm and Serenity of Mind. There is no Object that can raiſe any Storm in him; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can breed in him uneaſie De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Fears. He that loves the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> is fixt on an immutable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Good: and he that <hi>now</hi> quits all for God, ſhall <hi>one day</hi> participate of the Fulneſs of God, and that for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="531" facs="tcp:29455:271"/>Need I invite and exhort Man to <hi>Humility?</hi> need I guard him againſt ſpiritual <hi>Pride?</hi> one would think 'twere altogether uſeleſs to attempt it. Is it poſſible that the <hi>Creature</hi> ſhould think himſelf ſo independent of his <hi>Creator,</hi> that he ſhould be able to pay him more Service than were due to him? Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that Man ſhould ſet ſuch a rate upon his own Righteouſneſs, as to think it capable of deſerving the utmoſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that an Infinite God can beſtow upon him? Is it poſſible, in a word, that <hi>Man,</hi> poor, frail, ſinful, <hi>Man, Man</hi> that can do nothing that is good, but by the Aſſiſtance of Divine Grace; <hi>Man</hi> deprav'd, and corrupted in his <hi>Nature,</hi> and but a very ill husband of <hi>Grace;</hi> is it poſſible, I ſay, that <hi>Man</hi> ſhould be <hi>proud</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> towards that glorious and incomprehenſible Being, who is the Creator and Lord, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch and Patron, the God and Father of Heaven and Earth? But as abſurd as this is, univerſal Experience teaches us, that <hi>Humility,</hi> true <hi>Humility</hi> is a hard Leſſon: and that very excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are not out of the Danger of falling into vicious Elations of Mind.

therefore to promote the one and ſecure us againſt the other, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe two or three Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There never was meer Man yet that did not fall ſhort of his Duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Man</hi> is the Creature of <hi>God,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon Him, and has receiv'd all from him: and therefore let him do the utmoſt he can, he does no more than his <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. God ſtands in no Need of our Service: and 'tis our <hi>own</hi> not <hi>his</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt we promote by it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There never was mere Man yet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For Proof of this, I will not flie to Original Corruption, or Sins of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. Alas! I need not. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. and 2. lays the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Juſtification by Faith, in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Defection and Depravation of Mankind. <hi>They are altogether gone out of the way, there is none that doth Good, no not one.</hi> And what <hi>Sins</hi> he there charges the World with, the <hi>Catalogue</hi> he gives us of them will inform us. But are <hi>we</hi> no better than <hi>they?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:29455:272"/>
the Light of the Goſpel, and the preventing Grace of God has undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly given a great Check to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Sin in the World: but ſince no Man can be Juſtified but through Faith in the Blood of Jeſus, 'tis plain that <hi>we</hi> too muſt be concluded under Sin. And though <hi>our</hi> Sins may not in the Number, or Scandal of them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual <hi>theirs,</hi> yet we ought to remember too, that every Sin is the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking, the more voluntary it is; and the greater the Grace is which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts and deſpiſes. But what need I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our Selves with the <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile?</hi> what need I prove by Argument and Authority that no Man ever yet liv'd, or will live without Sin? I mean Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin. Who ever yet look'd back di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently into his paſt Life, and did not meet with Stains and Deformities e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough? when I conſider what Legions of Sins are rang'd under thoſe two Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Devil, the Filthineſs of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> when I call to mind Envy, Diſcontent, Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Diſtruſt, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Wilfulneſs, Contention, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, Paſſion, Diſſimulation, Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:29455:273"/>
Flattery, and a thouſand other Sins; and when I reflect upon the Weakneſſes and Prepenſions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the almoſt innumerable Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to which we are expoſed, I muſt confeſs I am not at all ſurpriſed to think, that no Fleſh can be Juſtified in the Sight of God by a Covenant of Works: And when ever I find any upon a Death-bed, as I do ſome, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting themſelves from the Guilt of any Deliberate Wickedneſs, I rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire their Ignorance, and Partiality, than their Innocence. And yet, after all, a good Man is not to examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, only concerning the Evil that he has done, but alſo concerning the Good which he has omitted. He muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, how far he has fallen ſhort of that Poverty of Spirit, and Purity of Heart, which he ought to have come up too: and how far he has been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in thoſe Duties which a thorough Zeal would have puſh'd him on too: And when he has done this, let him be proud if he can.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Man</hi> is the Creature of <hi>God,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon him, and has receiv'd all
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:29455:273"/>
from Him. And therefore let him do the utmoſt he can, he does no more than his Duty: and ſtrictly ſpeaking, cannot merit of <hi>him.</hi> He that will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>Merit,</hi> muſt be his own Maſter; he muſt have a Right over his own Actions; he muſt be free to diſpoſe of his Affections and Services as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. For if he be antecedently bound, if he have no Liberty, no Freedom, no Right to diſpoſe of himſelf, or any thing he is poſſeſſed of, 'tis plain ſuch a one cannot <hi>merit.</hi> And this is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Caſe between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> God is the great Lord, the great Proprietor of Heaven and Earth. He that gives Alms, does but reſtore a part of what God lent him: he that takes patiently the Loſs of Goods, or Health or Friends, does but give back what he had no right to retain: he was but Tenant at Will, and had no Right to any thing longer than God thought fit to continue it. And in all other Inſtances of Duty the Caſe will be ſtill plainer. If he adore, and worſhip God, there is infinite Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he ſhould; for he depends upon him for his Being, and Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If he love God never ſo much,
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:29455:274"/>
God has deſerv'd much more than he can pay Him: not only the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Life, but even Life it ſelf being derived from Him. From this Argument it will follow, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a <hi>Creature</hi> to <hi>merit</hi> of its <hi>Creator. Angels</hi> themſelves never could. For might it not be ſaid with as much Truth concerning them, as concerning Man, <hi>who made thee to differ, or what haſt thou which thou didſt not receive? and if thou haſt received it, why doſt thou boaſt as if thou hadst not received it?</hi> 1 Cor. 4.7. And the ſame may be concluded concerning <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi> For I demand, had he kept the Covenant of God, had he done this by Divine <hi>Grace,</hi> or by his <hi>own</hi> Strength'? If by the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, as Divines ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally hold, then may we apply the Expreſſion of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as to any one now under the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> That <hi>when God rewards the works of Man, he does only crown in him his own Gifts.</hi> But ſuppoſe he had done this by his <hi>own</hi> natural Strength: were not the Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Nature,</hi> as much the Gifts of <hi>God</hi> as the Endowments of <hi>Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:29455:274"/>
one were <hi>Natural,</hi> the other <hi>Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Gifts: both <hi>Gifts</hi> ſtill, though of a different kind. If it be here <hi>Objected,</hi> if this be ſo, how comes St. <hi>Paul</hi> to affirm, <hi>to him that worketh is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward due not of Grace but of Debt?</hi> Rom. 4.4. I <hi>anſwer, Firſt,</hi> God ſeems, when he enters into Covenant with Man, to ſuſpend, or lay aſide the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right which He has over him as his Creature; and to tranſact with him as free, and Maſter of himſelf: But this is all infinite condeſcenſion. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> it ſeems unſuitable to the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodneſs of God, to bereave Man of the Life and Happineſs he has once conferr'd upon him, unleſs he forfeits it by ſome Demerit: <hi>The Gifts and calling of God are without Repentance;</hi> nor can I think how <hi>Death,</hi> which has ſo much Evil in it, could have enter'd the World, if <hi>Sin</hi> had not enter'd it firſt. In this Senſe, <hi>unſinning</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence gives a kind of <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi> of thoſe good things, which are at <hi>firſt</hi> the meer Effects of Divine Grace and Bounty. <hi>Lastly,</hi> a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works being once eſtabliſh'd, 'tis plain that as Sin <hi>forfeits</hi> Life, ſo
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:29455:275"/>
Obedience muſt give a <hi>right</hi> to it: and as the Penitent could not be reſtored, but by an Act of Grace, ſo he that commits no Sin, would need no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. But then Life it ſelf, and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to work Righteouſneſs, muſt be owing to Grace antecedent to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:</hi> and ſo ſuch a one would have whereof to <hi>boaſt</hi> comparatively, with reſpect to <hi>others</hi> who fell; but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God.</hi> The Sum of all is, <hi>Man</hi> has nothing to render to <hi>God,</hi> but what he has received from him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can offer him nothing but <hi>his own:</hi> Which is no very good Foundation for Merit. But ſuppoſe him abſolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of himſelf: Suppoſe him holding all things independent of God. Can the Service of a few Days merit Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and Glory, Angelical Perfection, and a Crown? He muſt be made up of Vanity and Preſumption, that dares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <hi>this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. God ſtands in no need of our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and 'tis our <hi>own</hi> not <hi>his</hi> Intereſt we promote by it. The Foundation of Merit amongſt <hi>Men</hi> is <hi>Impotence</hi> and <hi>Want:</hi> the Prince wants the Service
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:29455:275"/>
and Tribute of the Subject; the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Protection of the Prince: the Rich needs the Miniſtry and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the Poor; the Poor Support and Maintenance from the Rich. And it is thus in Imaginary, as well as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Wants. The Luxury and Pleaſure of one, muſt be provided for and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Care and Vigilance of others: and the Pomp and the Pride of one part of the World cannot ſubſiſt, but on the Servitude of the other. In theſe Caſes therefore, mutual <hi>Wants</hi> create mutual Rights, and mutual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. But this is not the Caſe between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man. God</hi> is not ſubject to any Wants or Neceſſities: Nor is his Glory, or Happineſs capable of Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution or Increaſe. <hi>He</hi> is a Monarch, that needs no Tribute to Support his Grandeur, nor any Strength or Power, beſides his own, to guard his Throne. If <hi>we</hi> revolt, or rebel, we cannot injure <hi>Him:</hi> if <hi>we</hi> be loyal and obedient, we cannot profit <hi>Him.</hi> He has all Fulneſs, all Perfection in himſelf: He is an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and All-ſufficient God. But on the quite contrary, though <hi>God</hi> have no <hi>Wants, we</hi> have many: and though
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:29455:276"/>
                  <hi>his</hi> Majeſty and Felicity be ſubject to no Viciſſitude, <hi>we</hi> are ſubject to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Our Service to <hi>God</hi> therefore is our <hi>own</hi> Intereſt; and our Obedience is deſign'd to procure our <hi>own</hi> Advantage: we need, we daily need his Support and Protection; we depend entirely on His Favour and Patronage: <hi>in him we live, and move, and have our Being:</hi> and from <hi>Him,</hi> as from an inexhauſtible Fountain, we derive all the Streams of Good, by which we are refreſhed and improved. To know, and love Him is our Wiſdom; to depend upon Him, our Happineſs and Security; to ſerve and worſhip Him, our Perfection and Liberty; to enjoy Him will be our Heaven; and thoſe Glimpſes of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which we are vouchſafed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Spirit in this Life, are the Pledges and Foretaſte of it.

            <p n="5">
               <pb n="542" facs="tcp:29455:277"/>5. The <hi>Infirmity</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">§. 1. Some ſeem to have entertain'd ſuch a <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> as if Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration here, were as neceſſary as any where elſe. They look upon <hi>Zeal</hi> as as an <hi>Exceſs</hi> of Righteouſneſs: and can be well enough content to want Degrees of Glory, if they can but ſave their Souls. To which End they can ſee no Neceſſity of <hi>Perfection.</hi> Now I would beſeech ſuch ſeriouſly to lay to Heart, that Salvation and Damnation are Things of no <hi>common</hi> Importance: and therefore it highly concerns them not to be miſtaken in the <hi>Notion</hi> they form to themſelves of <hi>Religion.</hi> For the Nature of Things will not be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their Fancies; nor will God be mocked or impoſed on. If we will deal ſincerely with our ſelves, as in this Caſe it certainly behoves us to do, we muſt frame our <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> not from the Opinions, the Manners, or the Faſhions of the <hi>World,</hi> but from the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And we muſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret <hi>theſe</hi> by our own Inclinations; but we muſt judge of the Duties they preſcribe, by thoſe Deſcriptions of them,
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:29455:277"/>
by thoſe Properties and Effects, which we find there. We muſt weigh the <hi>Deſign</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of Religion; which is to promote the Glory of God, and the Good of Man, and to raiſe us above the World, and the Body: and ſee how our Platform, or Model of Religion <hi>ſuits</hi> with it. And if after we have done this, we are not fully ſatisfied in the true Bounds and Limits which part Vice and Vertue, it cannot but be ſafeſt for us to err on the right hand. We ought always to remember too, That the repeated Exhortations, in Scripture to Diligence and <hi>that</hi> the moſt earneſt and indefatigable, to Vigilance, to <hi>Fear, and Trembling,</hi> to Patience, to Steadfaſtneſs, and ſuch-like, are utterly inconſiſtent with an eaſier, lazy, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Religion. That the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the faireſt and fulleſt Comment on his <hi>Doctrine:</hi> and, That we never are to follow the Examples of a corrupt World, but of the beſt Men, and the beſt Ages. This, this one thing alone, will convince us, <hi>what</hi> Endeavours, <hi>what</hi> Vertues are neceſſary to gain an incorruptible Crown. See with what Eagerneſs the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>Jeſus preſſed
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:29455:278"/>
towards the mark!</hi> See with what Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, nay Joy too, they <hi>took up their Croſs and followed Him!</hi> how generous were their <hi>Alms!</hi> ſo that the <hi>Riches of their Liberality</hi> were conſpicuous in the very <hi>Depth of their Poverty.</hi> What Plainneſs, and Singleneſs of Heart; what Grace and Warmth, what Peace and Joy, ſhew'd it ſelf in their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation! what Modeſty, what Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in their Garb, Deportment, and the whole Train of Life! how frequent, how fervent, and how long too, were their Prayers and Retirements! In one word, the Spirit and Genius of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſt diſcover'd it ſelf in all they ſaid and did: and the Vertues of their <hi>Lives</hi> did as evidently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a <hi>Christian,</hi> from a <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> as their <hi>Faith.</hi> How lovely was Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>then!</hi> how full its Joy, how ſtrong its Confidence! <hi>Then</hi> did Chriſtians tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overcome the World: <hi>then</hi> did they live above the Body: <hi>then</hi> was the Croſs of Chriſt more delightful, than the Eaſe, or Honour, the Pride, or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, of a ſinful Life: <hi>then</hi> did they truly thorough the Spirit, wait for the Hope of Righteouſneſs by Faith. Let
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:29455:278"/>
us now compare <hi>our</hi> Lives with <hi>theirs,</hi> and then ſit down content with poor and beggarly Attainments if we can. Let us put <hi>our</hi> Vertues in the Scales againſt <hi>theirs;</hi> and, if we have any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, the Inequality will put us out of Countenance: we ſhall bluſh at our Vanity; and ſhall not have the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to expect the ſame Crown, the ſame Kingdom with them. But as too laxe a Notion of Religion is apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get too much Indifference, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernment; ſo will it be ſaid, too exalted a one is apt to beget <hi>Deſpair:</hi> which is a <hi>Second</hi> and no <hi>leſs Obſtacle</hi> of <hi>Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. Many there are, who forming their Judgment upon the Slips and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of good Men, and the Corruption of Human Nature, conceive <hi>Perfection</hi> to be a meer imaginary Notion. They believe indeed, that, conſidering how apt Man is to fall ſhort of his Duty, 'tis very fit that the Rule preſcrib'd him ſhould be exact; and that he ſhould be frequently preſſed, and exhorted to <hi>Perfection:</hi> but that the thing it <hi>ſelf</hi> is too too difficult for Mortal Man to
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:29455:279"/>
attain in this Life. But to this <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> I muſt oppoſe <hi>theſe</hi> few things which I believe will be ſufficient to remove it. 1. The <hi>Beginning</hi> of Vertue is the moſt difficult part of it: the nearer we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to <hi>Perfection,</hi> the eaſier, as well as pleaſanter, is Religion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whoever ſtartles at the Difficulties, which lie in the way to an exalted Vertue, has as much reaſon to be ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at thoſe which will encounter him in his firſt Enterance upon Religion: and yet <hi>theſe</hi> muſt be conquered. 2. The avoiding the Difficulties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, does but plung us into worſe. We are neceſſarily under this <hi>Dilemma:</hi> If we will attain the Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of the <hi>Mind,</hi> we muſt mortifie and reduce the Appetites of the <hi>Body:</hi> if on the other hand, we propoſe to gratifie the Appetites of the <hi>Body,</hi> and enjoy the Pleaſure of <hi>Sin,</hi> we cannot do ſo without offering much Violence to the <hi>Mind.</hi> And if this be ſo; if ſuch be the War and Oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soul and the Body, that there is no way to a true and well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Peace and Pleaſure, but by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and Mortification of the one,
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:29455:279"/>
or the other; <hi>then</hi> it will be eaſie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve what we are to do. For thoſe Appeals which Atheiſts themſelves make to Reaſon, proclaim the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man to be the Ruling and Nobler part of him. Beſides, the <hi>Soul</hi> is the more vital, the more tender, and ſenſible part of us: and conſequently, the Affliction of <hi>this</hi> muſt render us far more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, than any Hardſhips, or Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Vertue can impoſe upon the <hi>Body.</hi> 3. Whatever be the Difficulties of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> they will ſoon vaniſh if we often call to mind, That Peace and Joy are the <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>Vertue;</hi> but ſhame and Remorſe of <hi>Sin:</hi> That no Man ever yet did not repent of following his Luſt; unleſs he <hi>died</hi> as much a Brute as he <hi>lived:</hi> That Heaven is a cheap pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, whatever it coſts us; but the Pleaſure of Sin a very dear one, how eaſily ſoever we come by it: And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, That we are not our own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: there is a God to whom we ſtand accountable for our Actions: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, whether we will, or will not, we muſt either undergoe the Hardſhip and Diſcipline of Vertue, or the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Plagues and Puniſhments of Sin.
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:29455:280"/>
Laſtly, the Truth is, this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> of <hi>Perfection</hi> has both been begot and cheriſhed by thoſe wild <hi>Schemes</hi> of it, which have been drawn by the hands of a flaming, indeed, but an indiſcreet Zeal. But I have here recommended to the World, no fantaſtick, or Enthuſiaſtick <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> I have advanced no Heights of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; but what many do, I hope, at this day actually feel and experiment in themſelves: none, I am ſure, but what the <hi>Followers</hi> of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attain and practiſe. <hi>Be ye followers of us,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>as we are of Chriſt. Their</hi> Lives were as bright a Rule as their Doctrine: and by their own Actions they demonſtrated the Power of the Faith they taught, They did not like the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees, bind heavy Burdens upon others, and not move them with their finger;</hi> they did not like <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> magnifie Temperance and Modeſty at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Carnivals of Princes; nor commend the Pleaſure of Wiſdom in in the Gardens of <hi>Epicurus:</hi> but they <hi>lived</hi> as they <hi>taught,</hi> unſpotted by the Pleaſures, unbroken by the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:29455:280"/>
of the World; modeſt, Serene, equal and Heavenly minded, in Honour, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, Want, or Abundance, Liberty, or Priſon Life, or Death. Let us then no longer <hi>Object,</hi> or <hi>Diſpute,</hi> but with Faith and Patience be followers of thoſe who have inherited the Promiſes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>encompaſs'd with a Cloud of Witneſſes, let us lay aſide every Weight, and the Sin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us; and let us run with Patience the race that is ſet before us: looking unto Jeſus, the author and finiſher of our Faith; who for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God. For conſider him that endured ſuch Contradiction of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners against himſelf; lest ye be wearied and faint in your Mind,</hi> Heb. 12.1, 2. I have done with thoſe who endeavour to <hi>ſoften</hi> or <hi>ſhun</hi> the Difficulties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion not to <hi>conquer</hi> them.</p>
            <p n="3">§ 3. There are <hi>others</hi> who will look upon this ſetting up the Doctrine of <hi>Perfection,</hi> as a Deſign againſt the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of Mankind. What, ſays ſuch a one, ſhall I let go my preſent
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:29455:281"/>
               <hi>Pleaſures</hi> out of my hands, to hunt after I know not what, and I know not where? Shall I quit <hi>Pleaſures</hi> tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are every where obvious, for ſuch as have no Being, it may be, but in Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? or at leaſt are never to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any, but ſome few, rare and happy Creatures, the Favourites of God and Nature? <hi>Pleaſures</hi> that have Matter and Subſtance in them, for ſuch as I can no more graſp and reliſh than I can Dreams and Viſions? But to this I anſwer, this pretty talk is all but ſtupid Ignorance, and groſs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes. For, 1. As to innocent and vertuous <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> no Man needs part with it. I endeavour not to deprive Man of <hi>this;</hi> but to refine and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie it. And he that prefers, either ſilly, or vicious <hi>Pleaſure</hi> before Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is wretchedly miſtaken. For, 2. <hi>Perfect</hi> Religion is full of <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> Had we but once arrived at true Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Heart, what could be ſo full of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> as the Buſineſs of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? what can be more delightful than bleſſing and praiſing God, to a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul; <hi>Allelujahs,</hi> to a Soul ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the brink of Deſtruction, into
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:29455:281"/>
the Boſom of its Maſter? what can be more Tranſporting than the melting Tenderneſſes of a holy Contrition; made up, like <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s, of Tears and Kiſſes, Sorrow and Love, Humility and Glory, Confuſion and Confidence, Shame and Joy? what can be more tranſporting than Love, the Love of a Chriſtian; when he is all <hi>Love, as God is Love;</hi> when he <hi>deſires nothing in Heaven, nor on Earth, but God;</hi> when <hi>all things are dung and droſs to him in Compariſon of Jeſus?</hi> 4. If the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> be more tranſporting than thoſe of <hi>Religion?</hi> 'tis becauſe our Faith is weak, our Love imperfect, and our Life unſteady. A conſtant and exalted <hi>Pleaſure</hi> is, I grant it, the Fruit of <hi>Perfection</hi> alone. The <hi>Peace and Joy</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt reigns no where, but where that <hi>Zeal and Love,</hi> which is an Effect of the Fulneſs of the Spirit, reigns too. I had once propoſed to have inſiſted on the Reaſons of this here: but this Labour is prevented; for they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obvious to any one, who hath read the <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Zeal</hi> with Seriouſneſs and Attention. Laſtly what is inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:29455:282"/>
in the <hi>Objection,</hi> that the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> are more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or obvious, than thoſe of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> is altogether a falſe and groundleſs Fancy. In every Place, and in every State, do the Pleaſures of Vertue wait upon the <hi>Perfect</hi> Man. They depend not, like thoſe of the Body, on a thouſand things that are not in our power, but only on God, and our own Integrity. But this part of the Objection I have, I think, for ever baffled, <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. Theſe <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles</hi> of <hi>Perfection</hi> being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the Mind of Man being fully convinced of the Happineſs that reſults from a State of <hi>Perfection,</hi> and of his Obligation to ſurmount the Difficulties which obſtruct his way to it; there ſeems to be nothing now left to diſappoint the Succeſs of this Diſcourſe, but ſomewhat too much Fondneſs for the <hi>World,</hi> or ſomewhat too much Indulgence to the <hi>Body;</hi> which I am <hi>next,</hi> though but very <hi>briefly,</hi> to conſider.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="553" facs="tcp:29455:282"/>§. 4. There is a <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> which though it be not either for the Matter, or Degree of it, Criminal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to deſtroy our Sincerity, and our Hopes of Salvation, yet is it ſtrong enough to abate our Vigour, hinder our <hi>Perfection,</hi> and bereave us of many Degrees of Pleaſure at preſent, and Glory hereafter. The <hi>Indications</hi> of this kind of Love of the World are, too much concern for the Pomp and Shew of Life; too much Exactneſs in the Modes and Cuſtoms of it; too quick a Senſe of Honour and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Pre-eminence and Praiſe; too much Haſt, and too much Induſtry to grow rich, to <hi>add Houſe to Houſe, Land to Land, and to cloath our Selves with thick and heavy Clay;</hi> too brisk a Reliſh of the Pleaſures of the World; too great a <hi>Gaiety</hi> of Mind upon the Succeſſes, too much <hi>Dejection</hi> upon the Diſaſters and Diſappointments of it; too much Care, and too much Diligence; an encumbring and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiling ones ſelf too far in worldly Affairs; too much Diverſion, too much Eaſe.

Symptoms of a Mind tainted with a Love of the World; though not ſo far as to Sickneſs and Death. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it will be enough to check the Vigour, and dilute the Reliſh of the Mind. Now the only way to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this Defect, and to captivate the Mind entirely to the Love and Service of Religion and Vertue, is to conſider frequently and ſeriouſly the Rewards of <hi>Perfection,</hi> the Pleaſure that will attend it in another Life. Had the <hi>young Man</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> done this, had he had as lively a Notion, and as true an Eſtimate, of the Riches of <hi>Eternity,</hi> as he had of <hi>Temporal</hi> ones, he would never <hi>have gone away ſorrowful,</hi> when he was adviſed to have exchanged the Treaſures of <hi>Earth</hi> for thoſe of <hi>Heaven.</hi> Had the Soul of <hi>Martha</hi> been as much taken up with the Thoughts of <hi>Eternity,</hi> as that of <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe would have made the ſame <hi>Choice</hi> as <hi>ſhe</hi> did. They who often <hi>think,</hi> how ſoon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, the Pomp and Grandeur of this World paſſes away, and how much better their <hi>Heavenly</hi> Country is than their <hi>Earthly;</hi> how much more
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:29455:283"/>
laſting, and how much more glorious, the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> that <hi>City that has Foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God,</hi> than this City of ours, which may be over-thrown in a moment; will neither weep, nor rejoyce, with too much Paſſion; neither buy, nor poſſeſs, with too much Application of Mind. In one word, he that ſo often and devoutly <hi>thinks</hi> of that day, wherein <hi>Chriſt, who is our Life, ſhall appear, and we alſo appear with him in Glory,</hi> that he comes to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>long</hi> for it; ſuch a one will have no great Taſte of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, or the Pleaſures, or the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Life: nor will he be ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or remiſs, but <hi>fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord:</hi> Whatever Degrees of Affection he had for any thing of that Nature, they will all vaniſh; he will have no Emulation, but for good Works, no Ambition but for <hi>Glory:</hi> I mean, <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>Eternal.</hi> In the purſuit of <hi>this</hi> will he lay out the Strength and Vigour of his Mind; for <hi>this</hi> he will retrench his Profit; for <hi>this</hi> he will deny his Pleaſure; for <hi>this</hi> he will be content to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:29455:284"/>
mean, and laborious: for if the <hi>World</hi> be once crucified to him, <hi>he</hi> will the more eaſily bear the being crucified to <hi>it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. After all, there is an <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> againſt which if we do not guard our ſelves, if we do not ſtruggle heartily, we ſhall miſcarry. <hi>The Spirit is willing,</hi> ſaid our Saviour, <hi>but the Fleſh is weak.</hi> Without much Care, and much Watchfulneſs, the Vigour of our Minds will be relax'd; the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultation of our Spirits will flag, and droop; and we ſhall ſoon looſe the Reliſh there is in Religion. The moſt effectual <hi>Remedies</hi> againſt this Frailty and Fickleneſs of our Nature are <hi>two. First,</hi> Godly <hi>Fear;</hi> and <hi>this,</hi> the Purity and Preſence of God; the Strictneſs and the Impartiality of a Judgment to come; the Loſs of an Eternal Crown; the Terrors of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Puniſhment; the Number and Strength of Temptations; the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Falls of the greateſt Saints; and the Conſcience of our own Weakneſs, will not fail to work in us. Let us then, not only <hi>begin</hi> but alſo <hi>perfect Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:29455:284"/>
in the Fear of God. Bleſſed is he that feareth always. Secondly,</hi> The Steadfaſtneſs of <hi>Hope;</hi> of Hope that waits and longs for the Coming of our Lord. <hi>This</hi> will invite us often to take a View of <hi>Canaan: this</hi> will fill the Mind often with the Beauties and the Glories of Eternity: <hi>this</hi> will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten call to our Thoughts, and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the Reſt, the Tranſports of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World; the Love of God and of Jeſus; incorruptible Crowns; the Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah's of Angels, the Shouts of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, the Fruit of the Tree of Life, the Streams that water the Paradiſe of God. And every ſuch Object will chide us out of our Weakneſs and Cowardiſe: every ſuch Thought will upbraid us out of our Lazineſs and Negligence: We ſhall hear always Sounding in our Ears the Words of <hi>Jeſus</hi> to his <hi>Diſciples, What, can ye not watch with me one hour,</hi> and yet do you expect to reign with me for ever? Or thoſe to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Laodicea, to him that overcometh will I grant to ſit with me upon my Throne; as I have overcome, and am ſate down with my Father on his Throne.</hi>

               <pb n="558" facs="tcp:29455:285"/>And now, <hi>Reader,</hi> if you find I have done you any Service, if you think your ſelf under any Obligation to <hi>me,</hi> the <hi>Return</hi> I beg from you is, that you will <hi>first,</hi> offer Praiſe and Thanks unto God; and <hi>next</hi> whenever you are in the Vigour of the Spirit, in the Ardors of Faith and Love, before God in Prayer, put up theſe, or the like Petitions for me, which I now offer up for my ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O My God, and my Father, increaſe the Knowledge of thy Word, and the Grace of thy Spirit in me. Enable me to Perfect Holineſs in thy Fear; and to hold fast the ſteadfastneſs of my Hope unto the End. Pardon all the Sins, and Errors of my Life: and accept of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Services though Jeſus Chriſt. And becauſe, though after all we can do, we are unprofitable Servants, thy Infinite Bounty will yet certainly recompenſe our ſincere Endevour to promote thy Glory, let me find my Reward from thee: or rather do thou thy ſelf vouchſafe to be my Reward. I ſhould have ever thought my ſelf unworthy to have put up this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:29455:285"/>
to thee, O thou glorious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Majeſty, had not thine own Goodneſs, thine own Spirit kindled this Ambition in me. Behold! what manner of Love is this, that we ſhould be called the Sons of GOD! theſe are the Words of thy Servant St.</hi> John: <hi>And now therefore my Soul can never be at rest, till I awake at the laſt Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy Likeneſs; I can never be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till I behold thy Glory: which vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe me, I beſeech thee, by thy Mercy, and thy Faithfulneſs; by the Sufferings and Interceſſion of thy Dearly Beloved Son.</hi>
